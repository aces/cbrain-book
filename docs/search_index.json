Behind the web-portal, CBRAIN manages data access, transfer, \ncaching and provenance, as well as data processing and reporting.

CBRAIN supports clusters running Sun Grid Engine\n(SGE), MOAB, Torque/PBS, or simple UNIX processes, transparently.\nOther adapters are easy to implement.\nFiles can be displayed or accessed on the web interface according\nto their own internal representation. For example a JPEG file can\nbe viewed, or an MRI file can be parsed slice-by-slice on the web\ninterface.\nFiles and tasks are deployed as plugins, so a CBRAIN administrator\ncan write his own or simply import them from other developers.\n\nWhere does it come from?\nThe CBRAIN service was originally conceived\nthrough a CANARIE\ngrant awarded to Professor Alan C. Evans, at\nMcGill University. The resulting internal\ncode platform was meant\nto provide easy access to complex neuroimaging computational tools, for\nclinicians or neuroscience researchers with limited IT resources. Despite\nthe name, the framework is designed to be general, and can accommodate any\ndata and task for any application. This GIT repository contains the\ngeneric core of the framework, which is not specific to any field of science.\nWho should use CBRAIN?\nAny research group that depends on medium to large-scale computational data\nanalysis, can benefit from CBRAIN's data and task management back engine.\nCBRAIN provides tools for archiving raw and processed data files, viewing them,\nand processing then in batch. For example, an astronomy researcher's lab could deploy\nCBRAIN and configure its data servers for storage of its instrument's acquisitions,\nand to launch its in-house data processing/analysis software on some preconfigured\nsupercomputer cluster.\nCiting CBRAIN\nIf you publish results from deploying a CBRAIN instance, please cite the following\nreference:\nSherif T, Rioux P, Rousseau M-E, Kassis N, Beck N, Adalat R, Das S, Glatard T and Evans AC (2014)CBRAIN: a web-based, distributed computing platform for collaborative neuroimaging research.Front.

This is to avoid duplicating\nthese files, since these two applications share a lot of code.\nWhen deploying any of the components shown in the diagram above, it is\nnecessary to perform one extraction of the full source tree (both\napplications) for each BrainPortal or Bourreau. If you install\nseveral Bourreaux, even on the same server and under the same UNIX\nusername, you need to extract the source code separately.\nOverview of installation\nThe installation documentation is split into three separate guides.\nBuilding a CBRAIN installation is done incrementally, whether you are setting up\na personal development CBRAIN or a production installation.\nFor a personal development environment\nFollow the steps in these two guides only once:\n  Common Setup -> BrainPortal Setup\nNext, set up a single development Bourreau using the Bourreau \nsubdirectory that is directly next to the BrainPortal which has \njust been set up:\n  Bourreau Setup\nIf you plan to add any other Bourreaux to the installation,\nconnect to the computers where you will set them up and follow\nthe steps in these two guides for each of them:\n  Common Setup -> Bourreau Setup\nFor a production environment\nAgain, follow the steps in these two guides only once:\n  Common Setup -> BrainPortal Setup\nThen, connect to each of the servers where you plan to\ninstall the Bourreaux and for each of them, follow\nthese steps:\n  Common Setup -> Bourreau Setup\nRemember that you cannot reuse the Bourreau directory\nbranch between distinct Bourreau applications that you want to\nconfigure.\n\nif ('UA-XXXXXXXXX-X') {\n\t(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n\t(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n\tm=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n\t})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n\tga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');\n\tga('send', 'pageview');\n}\n\n"},"1-setup/Common-Setup.html":{"url":"1-setup/Common-Setup.html","title":"Common setup","keywords":"","body":"This document is the first section of three explaining how to install \nthe CBRAIN platform:\n  Common Setup -> BrainPortal Setup -> Bourreau Setup\nFor a general overview of these documents, please refer to\nthe section, \"Overview of installation process\", in the Setup Guide.\nThis particular document explains how to install the UNIX environment\nand files common to both the BrainPortal Rails and Bourreau Rails applications.\nThis document describes the initial installation steps for either:\n\nA personal CBRAIN server for development by an individual programmer, or\nA production server for multiple users.\n\nIt is assumed that the person reading this document is a reasonably competent UNIX \nuser and familiar with command-line environments, as well as typical system \nadministration concepts such as libraries, packages, filesystem paths, networking and \nenvironment variables.\nAll commands shown in this guide use the bash command-line interpreter.\nAbout the platform\nCBRAIN is a Ruby on Rails application at its core. You can find out\nmore about Ruby (the programming language) and Ruby on Rails (the\nweb-based framework) online here: rubyonrails.org\nThe two Rails applications\nThere are in fact two distinct types of Rails applications in a typical CBRAIN\ninstallation:\n\nA BrainPortal application, which provides the CBRAIN web frontend and\nmost of the other capabilities of the platform.\n\nA Bourreau application, which is a simpler, lighter Rails application that\nis deployed on each of the supercomputer servers and receives commands\nfrom the BrainPortal application.\n\n\nThe three Rails environments\nIn Rails, there are development and test environments that\nare mostly used by individual programmers working on an application.\nFor CBRAIN, this usually consists of a single BrainPortal\napplication running locally and a single Bourreau application\nrunning alongside. In this case the Bourreau application appears\nto be on a supercomputer server even though it is likely just running\non the programmer's own desktop computer.\nA production environment usually consists of a set of multiple\ninstances of the BrainPortal application running on the main web\nserver and a single Bourreau application running separately on\neach of the supercomputer clusters that are available to users. \nAs a side note, Bourreau (pronounced \"Boo-Row\") is the French\nword for an executioner (the profession) and its plural is Bourreaux\n(pronounced exactly the same way, since the \"x\" is silent).\nSystem requirements\nBefore installing CBRAIN, make sure that the system meets the following\nbasic requirements.\nSupported operating systems\nCBRAIN has been developed and deployed successfully on two major classes \nof operating systems:\n\nMac OS X, versions named Snow Leopard all the way to Mavericks\n(and it would probably work on later versions too).\nLinux, in particular the CentOS and Ubuntu distributions.\n\nWith a few adjustments to the following instructions, CBRAIN can likely \nbe deployed on many other flavors of Linux or other UNIX operating systems.\nOpenSSH\nOpenSSH is normally installed on the aforementioned operating\nsystems. If you are using Linux and it has not been installed, use the local \npackage manager to install it or ask the system administrator to do so.\nMySQL or MariaDB\nAccess to a MySQL server is necessary. You can either install your own \nMySQL server or use one already available. It is necessary to have on \nthe server:\n\nA standard user account (do not use the root account!).\nA database with full write access. This database must also be blank, \nmeaning that it exists (with any name that you choose) but\nthere are NO TABLES in it yet.\n\nIt is outside the scope of this guide to describe the steps necessary\nto set up such a system. But there is plenty of documentation online\nexplaining how to install a MySQL server, create an account, and \ncreate a database on it. Nevertheless, the basic steps for \nsetting up a MySQL administrator account (assuming we are creating a \ndatabase for a development environment) are as follows:\ncreate database cbrain_dev;\ncreate user     'cbrain'@'localhost' identified by 'oh-oh-this-is-a-pw';\ngrant all on cbrain_dev.* to 'cbrain'@'localhost';\n\nNote that the database is never accessed from any other machine than\nthe one where the BrainPortal is installed; all the other resources\nthat need to access it within the CBRAIN system do so using\nSSH tunnels. This is a convenient security feature, as it means the\ndatabase server never has to be directly exposed to the outside world.\nMore information about the communication infrastructure can be found\nin the CBRAIN Communications document.\nA note about MariaDB: the CBRAIN developers have never tested\nCBRAIN on MariaDB, but are quite confident that it would work\nperfectly well with it too.\nXcode for Mac OS X\nIf Mac OS X is used for development, then it is necessary to install \nXcode. A typical Macintosh computer does not come with any development\ntools and so they must be installed separately. Xcode is free and\nprovided by Apple as a download.\nSoftware installation\nCBRAIN is a complex piece of Ruby software, but its installation is\nmade much simpler by the use of a few excellent external applications.\nRVM\nRVM (Ruby Version Manager) is an all-in-one\nsolution for installing and managing Ruby interpreters and Ruby\nlibraries packaged as gems.  The instructions for installing RVM \nwith a UNIX account can be found on the web site. We recommend setting\nup a plain RVM environment without installing any other components\nright away: the RVM documentation proposes an all-in-one installation\nof RVM, Ruby and Rails, but here we set them up separately.\nThe steps are as follows:\n\nInstall RVM itself\ncd $HOME\n# See the RVM home page to double-check the following command!\n# You will likely need to install a PGP key first.\n# See https://rvm.io\n\\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable\n# Follow the RVM instructions...\n\n\nLog out, and then log back in (to start a new shell session) and verify\nthat RVM is installed:\nrvm info\n\n\n\nA report shows the version of RVM that is installed and possibly other \nsystem information. If instead the message rvm: command not found is shown, \nthen either you did not log out or RVM was not installed properly.\nRuby\nIt is important to consider which version of Ruby to install. CBRAIN\nhas been tested and deployed on many Ruby versions including Ruby 2.2.0. This is the version that is currently \nrecommended (minor upgrades to this version are fine too). Ruby versions before 2.0 may not work well.\nIn the following steps, RVM is used to install Ruby.\nrvm install 2.2\n\nThis is often a step where problems occur; to install Ruby there are \nseveral system libraries and packages that must also\nbe installed and RVM attempts to install them. If you are using\na system where you do not have administrative privileges, ask the \nsysadmin to do this for you. Once these packages are installed, \ntry installing Ruby again a second time.\nOnce Ruby is installed, use the following commands for RVM to use it \nas a default whenever you connect:\nrvm use 2.2\nrvm --default 2.2\n\nYou can run 'rvm info' again to make sure this version is selected.\nCBRAIN code base\nNext extract the CBRAIN code base to the location where you \nplan to deploy it. The easiest way to do this is to clone the \nrepository directly from GitHub.\ncd $HOME      # or anywhere else you prefer\ngit clone https://github.com/aces/cbrain.git\n\nThis creates a directory called 'cbrain' with all of the files\nfor the two Rails applications, in subdirectories named BrainPortal\nand Bourreau.\nGems\nRuby Gems are convenient packages for Ruby libraries and applications.\nA consequence of installing Ruby with RVM, as described above, is that \nyou should now have access to a utility called 'bundler' which provides \na nice front-end to installing and encapsulating a bunch of Ruby gems. If\n'bundler' is not installed (you can check with 'which bundle') then\nyou can install it with:\ngem install bundler\n\nAt this point the steps are different, depending on \nwhich of the following components you want to install:\n\nThe BrainPortal application (the web frontend),\nThe Bourreau (the execution server side application), or\nBoth \n\nIf you want to install the BrainPortal application, run the bundler \nfrom its directory and all the required Ruby Gems are installed. \nCarry out the following steps:\ncd cbrain/BrainPortal   # make sure you are IN BrainPortal/ !\nbundle install          # note: the command is 'bundle' without a 'r'\n\nIn the same way, if you want to install the Bourreau application, run the\nbundler from its directory:\ncd cbrain/Bourreau      # make sure you are IN Bourreau/ !\nbundle install          # note: the command is 'bundle' without a 'r'\n\nThe BrainPortal and Bourreau side each has a particular set of gems that they\nrequire, with some gems common to both. There are several gems that require\ncompilation of custom code and this is where most installation problems\noccur. Often it is simply a matter of installing some development libraries\non the system. \nHere is a table of libraries that are often required:\n\n\n\nCentOS package name\nUbuntu package name\n\n\n\n\nmysql-devel\nlibmysqlclient-dev\n\n\nlibxml2\nlibxml2\n\n\nlibxml2-devel\nlibxml2-dev\n\n\nlibxslt\nlibxslt\n\n\n\nThere is one more step, once all of the gems are installed. Because of a\ntiny bug in the install process of the gem 'sys-proctable', it is necessary \nto use the following procedure:\n\nFind out where the gem has been installed by the bundler.\nGo to that directory.\nRun the command 'rake install' (which modifies or copies a file,\nbut may also give error messages, which can be safely ignored):bundle show sys-proctable\n(copy the directory shown)\ncd /to/that/directory\nrake install\n\n\n\nPlugins installation\nSome components of CBRAIN can be installed separately. They\nare distributed in plugins packages; the structure of these\npackages is described in the Plugins Structure document,\nbut for the moment we only install the default components \nthat come with the base CBRAIN installation. If there are other \nthird-party plugins packages that you want to use, extract \nthem under 'BrainPortal/cbrain_plugins' first (even if right now \nyou plan to install only a Bourreau).\nInstalling the plugins packages requires running a rake task.\nFor a BrainPortal:\ncd BrainPortal\nrake cbrain:plugins:install:all\n\nFor a Bourreau:\ncd Bourreau\nrake cbrain:plugins:install:all\n\nThe base CBRAIN distribution comes with a plugins package\nalready extracted, called \"cbrain-plugins-base\", which\ncontains some simple Userfile and CbrainTask definitions. A\nCBRAIN installation would probably not work at all without\nthis package.\nThis rake task can be run many times without causing any problems.\nMoving on\nAt this point most of the basic files and programs needed to \nconfigure either the BrainPortal or Bourreau application are \nin place.\n\nIf you are installing a BrainPortal application, then follow the\ninstructions in the BrainPortal Setup document.\n\nIf you have already set up a BrainPortal and are ready\nto install a Bourreau (there can be more than one for each\nBrainPortal), then follow the instructions in the Bourreau Setup document.\n\n\nNote: Original author of this document is Pierre Rioux\n\nif ('UA-XXXXXXXXX-X') {\n\t(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n\t(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n\tm=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n\t})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n\tga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');\n\tga('send', 'pageview');\n}\n\n"},"1-setup/BrainPortal-Setup.html":{"url":"1-setup/BrainPortal-Setup.html","title":"BrainPortal setup","keywords":"","body":"This document is the second section of three explaining\nhow to install the CBRAIN platform:\n  Common Setup -> BrainPortal Setup -> Bourreau Setup\nTo get a general overview of these documents, please refer to the Setup Guide.\nThis particular document explains how to install the UNIX environment\nand files specific to the BrainPortal Rails application.\nFiles configuration\nWe assume at this point that you have deployed all the files\nas described in the Common Setup document.\nMost of the configuration steps in CBRAIN are done within the\ninterface. An exception to this is the initialization of the MySQL \ndatabase, as well as the step of setting up a few files which we will \ndo right now. Both of these steps are necessary before it is possible \nto launch the interface.\nDatabase connection\nThe database connection is defined by a single file that\nonly needs to exist on the BrainPortal side. Look in the \nBrainPortal/config directory for the template for \nRail's database connection file, called database.yml.TEMPLATE.\nCopy it to database.yml and edit it with your favorite text editor.\ncd BrainPortal/config\ncp database.yml.TEMPLATE database.yml\n$EDITOR database.yml\n\nThere are three sections in this file, development, production\nand test, which correspond to three Rails environments. Each\nenvironment needs its own MySQL database, with its own database user.\nEnter the name of the MySQL server, the database name and the user for \neach of the sections that you plan to use. These values correspond to the \nconfiguration of the database server, as described in the preceding \nCommon Setup document.\nFor a programmer planning to use his own workstation for development, \nit is acceptable to point the development and production\nenvironments to exactly the same database and have a separate database\nfor test. For a full production setup, you can configure the\nproduction connection profile and remove the other two.\nApplication name\nEach BrainPortal application has a name that it uses to find\nitself in the MySQL database when it runs. The name needs to be\nconfigured as a file that the application loads.\nGo to the BrainPortal/config/initializers\nsubdirectory and copy the file config_portal.rb.TEMPLATE\nas config_portal.rb. Note: Do not simply rename it, since the\nTEMPLATE file is also used by the database seeding process,\ndescribed below.\nEdit 'config_portal.rb'. There is a single assignment for a \nconstant named CBRAIN_RAILS_APP_NAME. Give the\napplication a simple name, such as 'AstroPortal' or 'MyDev'.\nWhenever the Rails application boots, it looks up this name\nin the database; both need to be kept in sync if you ever \nchange the name.\nDatabase schema initialization\nRails provides a mechanism to initialize your database. It\ncreates the full set of tables needed by your applications and\npopulates them with the minimal amount of data necessary to get\nstarted. You only need to do this once and only on the BrainPortal\nside (Bourreaux do not have their own database, they use one set up\non a BrainPortal elsewhere).\ncd BrainPortal\nrake db:schema:load RAILS_ENV=development   # creates tables\n\nYou need to adjust the RAILS_ENV value of these commands to\ncorrespond to the environment you set up.\nWe assume here that the database has already been set up, as explained\nabove in the MySQL section.\nSeeding the database is also performed by a rake task:\ncd BrainPortal\nrake db:seed RAILS_ENV=development # initializes the tables\n\nThis creates three ActiveRecord objects in the database:\n\nIt reads the name of the application from the config\nfile which was set up above and creates an entry for the application\nin the database (FYI: table=remote_resources, type='BrainPortal').\nThis entry is incomplete and is completed later using the\nweb interface.\n\nIt creates a special default Projects called 'everyone',\nwhich is used to assign resources that everyone can access\n(FYI: table=groups, type='EveryoneGroup').\n\nIt creates the main admin user and assigns it a password\n(FYI: table=users, type='CoreAdmin').\n\n\nThe seeding process creates the password for the admin user.\nPlease write it down, since you need it to connect to the web\ninterface. However, if you do forget it, you can re-run the rake task later\nto reset the password.\nBrainPortal console checks\nThe Rails console is a great tool to inspect the entire CBRAIN\nsystem.  For the moment, we start it once in order to initiate a \nset of validation checks.\ncd BrainPortal\nrails console development     # note: for the console, no RAILS_ENV=\n\nwhich should produce something similar (but not identical to) this:\n(Excerpt from the boot log)\nC> CBRAIN BrainPortal validation starting, 2015-03-10 15:33:27 -0400\nC> Rails environment is set to 'development'\nC> CBRAIN instance is named 'PID-13978'\nC> Hostname is 'prcent'\nC>      - Note:  You can skip all CBRAIN validations by temporarily setting the\nC>               environment variable 'CBRAIN_SKIP_VALIDATIONS' to '1'.\nC> Ensuring that this CBRAIN app is registered in the DB...\nC>      - This CBRAIN app is named 'cportal' and is registered.\nC> Setting time zone for application...\nC>      - Warning: time zone not set properly for this Rails app, setting it to UTC.\nC> Making sure we can track file revision numbers.\nC> Cleaning up old SyncStatus objects...\nC>      - No SyncStatus objects are associated with obsolete resources.\nC>      - No SyncStatus objects are associated with obsolete files.\nC> Checking to see if Data Provider cache needs cleaning up...\nC>      - SKIPPING! No cache root directory yet configured!\nC> Current application tag or revision: 3.2.0-56\nC> Checking for pending migrations...\nC> Checking if the BrainPortal database needs a sanity check...\nC>      - Error: You must check the sanity of the models. Please run this\nC>               command: 'rake db:sanity:check RAILS_ENV=development'.\nNotice that the last message is an error indicating that a sanity check\nneeds to be run. Run the command provided in the message:\nrake db:sanity:check RAILS_ENV=development\n\nOnce this is done, you can start the console again:\nrails console development\n\nand you should get the console's prompt. You can type 'exit' to get\nout of the system, unless you are familiar with Rails and want to explore\nit a bit.\nThere are a few other important lines printed with the \"C>\" prefix \nduring the boot process. Notice that there is a warning about a \nmissing cache root directory and once you started the console it \nalso proceeded to create a SSH key, create a SSH Agent \nand create a SSH Agent Locker:\n(Excerpt from the boot log)\nC> Checking to see if Data Provider cache needs cleaning up...\nC>      - SKIPPING! No cache root directory yet configured!\n(...)\nC> Making sure we have a SSH agent to provide our credentials...\nC>      - Created new agent: PID=4610 SOCK=/home/user/cbrain/BrainPortal/tmp/sockets/ssh-agent.portal.sock\nC> Making sure we have a CBRAIN key for the agent...\nC>      - Creating identity file '/home/user/.ssh/id_cbrain_portal'.\nC>      - Added identity to agent from file: '/home/user/.ssh/id_cbrain_portal'.\nC> Starting automatic Agent Locker in background...\nC>      - No locker processes found. Creating one.\nLet's examine these items one by one.\n\nThe cache root directory is something which is configured with the\nweb interface in the next section.\n\nThe SSH identity file is created once for the entire lifetime of\na particular CBRAIN installation and is used to authenticate all\nrequests, local and remote, among its BrainPortal and Bourreau\ncomponents.\n\nThe SSH Agent is a UNIX subprocess that is involved in the authentication\nsystem; there only needs to be ONE such agent for the entire CBRAIN\ninstallation, even if multiple instances of the BrainPortal are running \n(such as in a production environment). Whenever an instance of the BrainPortal \napplication is started, it auto discovers the SSH agent and uses it.\nThis is a pretty standard UNIX 'ssh-agent' process, by the way, which can\nbe found by running the following UNIX command:\nps auxww | grep $USER | grep ssh-agent\n\n\nThe AgentLocker is also a separate UNIX process and is also unique to\nthe whole CBRAIN installation. It is a Ruby program that regularly\n'locks' the SSH Agent. The Programmer Guides have more information\nabout it. It can be found using this UNIX command:\nps auxww | grep $USER | grep AgentLocker\n\n\n\nInterface configuration\nAt this point it is possible to configure everything else from within \nthe CBRAIN interface. First, start a local BrainPortal server:\ncd BrainPortal\nrails server thin -e development -p 3000\n\nIf all is well, more or less the same boot messages appear as were \nshown earlier when launching the console. But this time the server\nsets up a network socket listening on port 3000. Open up a Web browser\nand connect to the URL for the server:\nhttp://localhost:3000/\nYou are prompted to login; the main administrative user is called\nadmin and the password is the one given to you when you ran the\nrake db:seed task above (which you can re-run if you forget \nthe password).\nOnce connected, the full administrative interface is visible. For\nthe moment we need to configure two parameters for the BrainPortal \napplication: the time zone and a path to the portal's data cache.\nGo to the 'Servers' tab. This is the index page for all the\nBrainPortal and Bourreaux on your \nsystem. A table is displayed, with a single entry for the current \nBrainPortal which is being used. Click on its name to view the \ninformation page for the BrainPortal, where each section and input \nfield can be edited.\nTime zone configuration\nClick on the (Edit) link in the top Info section\nand change the Time zone to match the current time zone.\nClick Update to apply the change.\nData cache configuration\nCreate an empty directory on your computer, on a filesystem\nwhere it is possible to store a large amount of scratch data. Use your\nbest judgement to choose the name and location for this directory,\nremembering that its purpose is to store copies of official\nCBRAIN data files for the BrainPortal, for operations such as \ntransfering data or viewing data with the BrainPortal interface. It \nis not simply scratch space, but it is not used to store \nimportant data files either.\nNow, return back to the interface and the BrainPortal page you\nwere just editing, and find the section Cache Management Configuration.\nClick the (Edit) link and enter the full path to that cache\ndirectory in the field Path to Data Provider caches .\nNote: This directory's content is NOT TO BE TOUCHED\nby external processes. Do no create or remove files from\nthe cache directory manually. The content should only be\nmanaged by CBRAIN's BrainPortal and not shared with\nother Rails applications, even within the CBRAIN installation.\nMoving on\nAt this point this is a functional BrainPortal application. It is possible \nto perform a number of typical actions, such as creating user accounts \nand projects. However, there is still no way to store data files anywhere \nand there are no execution servers to process them.\n\nConsider adding a few Data Providers to the installation as an admin.\nAside from having to create an empty directory, most of the\nconfiguration is done right from within the interface.\n\nIt is now also possible to install a Bourreau Rails application.\nThere can be more than one for each BrainPortal and usually they\nare installed on remote supercomputer sites, but you can start by \nconfiguring the one that is right beside your BrainPortal as a local \nexecution server. Follow the instructions in the Bourreau Setup \ndocument.\n\n\nNote: Original author of this document is Pierre Rioux\n\nif ('UA-XXXXXXXXX-X') {\n\t(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n\t(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n\tm=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n\t})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n\tga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');\n\tga('send', 'pageview');\n}\n\n"},"1-setup/Bourreau-Setup.html":{"url":"1-setup/Bourreau-Setup.html","title":"Bourreau setup","keywords":"","body":"This document is the third section of three explaining how to \ninstall the CBRAIN platform:\n  Common Setup -> BrainPortal Setup -> Bourreau Setup\nFor a general overview of these documents, please refer to\nthe the Setup Guide.\nThis particular document explains how to install the UNIX environment\nand files specific to the Bourreau Rails application. A\nCBRAIN installation can contain several Bourreaux, each one deployed\nwhere a particular execution environment is needed.\nBourreau Application\nWe assume that the code has been deployed and the files\nconfigured according to the previous steps in the guide. \nAt this point, the remaining configuration steps for a Bourreau \nserver can mostly be performed from the within the BrainPortal interface, \nbut there is one exception: the SSH connection between the two applications.\nSSH setup\nThe BrainPortal needs to be able to SSH to the host\nwhere the Bourreau application is installed. This is\ntrue even in a development environment where the\nBourreau is running on the same host, under the same user,\nand side by side on the file system.\nSince CBRAIN uses its own SSH key for all communications,\nit is necessary to install the key in the UNIX user account of\nthe host where the Bourreau is installed. For the sake\nof generality we define the following four concepts:\n\npuser: The UNIX username under which the BrainPortal is installed.\nphost: The hostname where the BrainPortal is installed.\nbuser: The UNIX username under which the Bourreau is installed.\nbhost: The hostname where the Bourreau is installed.\n\nNote that puser could be the same as buser and phost could\nbe the same as bhost. This is common in a development environment.\nThe SSH key created by the BrainPortal when you first\nbooted it is in puser_home/.ssh/id_cbrain_portal.pub (this\nis the public key of the key pair; leave the other one\nalone). The content of the key file is a single long\nline that you must copy to the other buser account\nand append to the file buser_home/.ssh/authorized_keys.\nIf the file does not exist, create it and verify that its\nprivileges are set to 600 (a.k.a rw-------). These\ncommands, sent from phost (where the BrainPortal\nis installed) do the following:\ncd $HOME/.ssh\ncat id_cbrain_portal.pub | ssh buser@bhost 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys;chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys'\n\nYou will likely be prompted to enter the password to connect to the remote\nsite.\nIf all is well, it should now be possible to SSH to the UNIX account where\nthe Bourreau is installed without having to enter a password. Try it\nfrom the BrainPortal side and make sure that no password is requested this time:\nssh buser@bhost hostname  # attempting to run the 'hostname' command remotely\n\nFinally, verify that running a non-interactive SSH command such as \nthat shown above works within the RVM environment on the Bourreau \nside. This can be done using the following command:\nssh buser@bhost rvm info\n\nIf a message is shown, such as rvm: command not found, or the \nrvm info output does NOT list the same thing as when you connect\ninteractively to bhost, then it is necessary to modify the bash initialization\nfiles. A standard RVM installation typically adds a line at the\nbottom of \".bash_profile\" or \".profile\" on bhost, which should be\nsimilar to this (but there is no guarantee that it will match perfectly):\n[[ -s \"$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm\" ]] && source \"$HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm\" # Load RVM into a shell session *as a function*\n\nVerify while still on 'bhost' that this line is in the \".bashrc\" file, usually near\nthe bottom, and that it is executed when you run 'rvm info'\nremotely as explained above. Once this is done, you can be certain\nthat any commands sent by the BrainPortal Rails server to the Bourreau\nRails server using a SSH command is invoked within RVM with its gems\nand Ruby.\nBourreau configuration\nAssuming that you have properly installed the Bourreau application's\ncode, named it and made sure you can SSH to its installation\nlocation with RVM properly activated, it is now possible to configure it \nusing the BrainPortal interface. Log in as admin, go back to the Server \nindex page (click on the 'Servers' tab), and click on `Create New Server'\nto bring up the required form.\nThe full description of the content of this form can be found in\nthe Execution Servers guide, but for the moment we fill in\nonly the minimum set of fields necessary to configure a\nBourreau server.\n\nIn the Info section:\nName: Use exactly the same name that is in the file Bourreau/config/initializers/config_bourreau.rb\n\n\nIn the SSH Remote Control Configuration section:\nHostname: The UNIX hostname where the Bourreau is installed (equivalent\nto bhost in the instructions above).\nUsername: The UNIX username on the host (equivalent to buser).\nPort Number: This is optional and usually 22 for SSH. If the SSHD server listens\non a different port, specify it here.\nRails Server Directory: The full path where the Bourreau\nRails application code is installed, for instance, /home/user/cbrain/Bourreau.\n\n\nIn the Tunnelling Configuration section: (see also Communications)\nDatabase Server Remote Tunnel Port: The choice of port number is arbitrary\nand can be any number between 1024 and 65535. The Bourreau application uses \nthis port on the remote host to connect back to the MySQL server used by \nBrainPortal. The tunnel is set up automatically, so it is only necessary to make \nsure that this port number is not in use by any other application on the host \nwhere the Bourreau runs.\nActive Resource Remote Tunnel Port: Again, the choice of port number \nis arbitrary, but this time the port is open on the BrainPortal side\nand allows the BrainPortal to send commands the Bourreau side.\n\n\nIn the Cache Management Configuration section:\nPath to Data Provider caches: Just like the BrainPortal application, each\nBourreau needs its own directory where it can cache data. Create a new empty\ndirectory on the Bourreau's host and enter its full path here. As usual, make\nsure this directory is not shared with anything else and not even used as\na cache by any other CBRAIN Rails application. If the Bourreau is on\nthe frontend of a supercomputer, this directory should be on a filesystem\nvisible from all the compute nodes of the supercomputer.\n\n\nIn the Cluster Management System Configuration section:\nType of cluster: The Bourreau schedules tasks on a supercomputer cluster, \nor on your own machine. Enter the type of cluster you have access to on the \nmachine where the Bourreau is installed. Typically, supercomputers have cluster \nmanagement systems with names such as SGE (Sun Grid Engine), Torque or \nMOAB. UNIX can also be selected, in which case no cluster management \nsystem is used, but the Bourreau simply launches the tasks as standard UNIX \nprocesses. This is usually a very good choice for a programmer's development \nenvironment.\nPath to shared work directory: Just like for the cache directory, this needs\nto be configured with the full path to an empty directory created on the Bourreau \nside. And again, it must not be shared with any other resource. This directory is \nthe location where subdirectories are created for each task launched on this Bourreau. \nIf the Bourreau is on the frontend of a supercomputer, then this directory should be \non a filesystem visible from all the compute nodes of that supercomputer.  For a \nprogrammer's personal development environment, any new empty directory is fine.\n\n\nIn the Bourreau Workers Configuration section:\nNumber of workers: Configure a small number of worker subprocesses that\nare launched on the Bourreau side to handle the tasks running there. On a\ndevelopment machine, a single worker checking the task list once every 10\nseconds is a good choice. On the production frontend of a supercomputer, with\ntasks lasting several hours each and dozens of users simultaneously submitting\nnew ones regularly, it would be appropriate to have 3 or 4 workers checking the \ntask list once per minute or even less.\n\n\n\nAfter editing each section, click 'Update' to save the values.\nMoving on\nAt this point you can start and stop the Bourreau application\nusing the BrainPortal web interface. Go to the 'Servers' tab\nand find the Bourreau's name on the list. Clicking the\n'start' link in that row initiates the following steps:\n\nThe portal establishes a persistent SSH master connection\nto the host where the Bourreau is located (see also Communications).\nThrough the SSH connection, it sends some shell commands\nto create a temporary database.yml file in the Bourreau/config\nsubdirectory and starts the Bourreau Rails application.\nIf successful, it also sends the Bourreau a special\nCBRAIN command to start its Worker subprocesses.\n\nThe Bourreau is ready to accept tasks once CBRAIN Tools\nare configured for it by the CBRAIN administrator.\nNote: Original author of this document is Pierre Rioux\n\nif ('UA-XXXXXXXXX-X') {\n\t(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n\t(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n\tm=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n\t})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n\tga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');\n\tga('send', 'pageview');\n}\n\n"},"1-setup/Communications.html":{"url":"1-setup/Communications.html","title":"Communications","keywords":"","body":"This page describes the different communication channels and protocols\nthat connects the main components of a typical CBRAIN installation.\nPlease refer to this diagram while reading the descriptions below it.\n\nComponents\nThere are three types of components shown in this picture: a\nPortal is a Rails application, a Bourreau (a.k.a Execution\nServer) is another Rails application, and a Data Provider is an\nabstract storage area. Each component is here located on a separate\nhost (the black boxes), but the discussion also applies when they\nare combined. There are a few more notes to say about these components:\n\nThe Portal is unique within a CBRAIN installation, although\nas is common for Rails applications, several instances of the Rails\napplication can be running.\n\nThere can be several Bourreaux within a CBRAIN installation;\nhowever, each one only runs a single instance of its Rails\napplication.\n\nThere can be several Data Providers within a CBRAIN installation.\nSome of them do not require network connections to be operation,\nit depends on their types. Here we will only consider\nData Providers that implement their data transfers through SSH\nnetwork connections.\n\n\nTypes of communication channels\nSome communication channels are persistently opened, and some\nare created on demand. These can be distinguished by the use of\nsolid or dashed lines.\nThe types of communications vary greatly: there are XML messages\nexchanged over HTTP, SQL databases connections, non interactive\nbash commands over SSH, and SSH Agent requests.\nDescription of each channel\n\nA Portal's Rails application communicate with a SQL DB Server\nusing a standard MySQL network connection. This is represented by\nthe purple line connecting the Portal's Rails application with the\nRails DB.\n\nA Portal's Rails application starts a persistent \"ssh-agent\"\nprocess to store and supply a SSH key for itself and other applications\nwithin the CBRAIN application. This is represented by the light\ngreen box in the Portal side.\n\nA Portal's Rails application maintain a persistent SSH network\nconnection to the host where a Bourreau is running. This is the\nsolid blue horizontal line connecting a \"ssh\" process of the Portal's\nhost to the \"sshd\" process of the Bourreau host. This SSH connection\ncan be used to carry four types of communications:\n\nBash commands are sent by the Portal to launch or stop the\nBourreau Rails application itself. This is represented by the\ndashed orange arrows on each side, going to \"ssh\" and emanating\nfrom \"sshd\".\n\nThe Bourreau Rails application accesses its MySQL DB server\nusing a local network address, which is tunneled by the local\n\"sshd\" back to the database server on the Portal side. This is\nrepresented by the solid purple arrows connecting the Bourreau's\nRails application, back through the persistent SSH connection,\nand emanating from the \"ssh\" process on the Portal side.\n\nXML messages are sent by the Portal through a SSH tunnel and\nreceived by the Bourreau Rails application over HTTP. These are\nrepresented by the dashed red arrows.\n\nWhenever the Bourreau's Rails application need to initiate\nnetwork connection of its own (for instance, when contacting a\nData Provider, as shown later in this document), it will spawn a\n\"ssh\" process which will require a key. The key will be provided\nby the SSH Agent forwarding mechanism of the main SSH connection.\nThis is represented by all the dashed light green arrows.\n\n\n\nWhen a Rails application (Portal or Bourreau) need to connect to\na networked Data Provider, a standard SSH connection is established.\n\nWhen the connection is initiated from the Portal, the connection\nis made persistent and re-used over time. This is represented by\nthe long diagonal solid blue arrow between the Portal and the\nData Provider.\n\nWhen the connection is initiated by a Bourreau, the connection\nis closed after each use. These is represented by the dashed\norange connection between the Bourreau and the Data Provider.\n\n\nIn both cases, the connection is used to launch bash commands\n(such as \"rsync\", or \"rm -rf\" etc). Also, in both cases, the \"ssh\"\ncommand that initiated the connection will authenticate by\ncontacting the SSH Agent.  On the Portal side, the SSH Agent\nprocess is local, so the \"ssh\" command contacts it directly using\nits UNIX-Domain socket. On the Bourreau side, as explained above,\nthe \"ssh\" command will contact a UNIX-Domain socket created by\nthe \"sshd\" of the persistent control connection, which will forward\nthe authentication to the SSH Agent running on the Portal.\n\n\nSSH Agent Locking\nAs an added security measure, the SSH Agent is periodically locked\nfor the entire CBRAIN installation (including the Portal and all\nBourreaux) one minute after it was last accessed. This is performed\nby a separate \"Agent Locker\" process, not shown in the diagram.\nWhenever a Rails application need access to the CBRAIN key, it needs\nto unlock it. The Rails code contain a method that is invoked before\neach SSH operation is performed, which will fetch the locking\npassword from the database, unlock the SSH Agent, and notify the\nAgent Locker process that the SSH Agent was unlocked. This notification\nis performed by adding a row to a database table which is monitored\nregularly by the the Agent Locker.\n(Original author: Pierre Rioux)\n\nif ('UA-XXXXXXXXX-X') {\n\t(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n\t(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n\tm=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n\t})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n\tga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');\n\tga('send', 'pageview');\n}\n\n"},"1-setup/Troubleshooting.html":{"url":"1-setup/Troubleshooting.html","title":"Troubleshooting","keywords":"","body":"Installation Issues\nInstalling the database\nThe Common Setup guide suggest running the two rake tasks\ndb:load and db:seed. A typical Rails installation also comes with\na rake task named db:setup which is supposed to do both, includig\ncreating the MySQL database for you. However, please note that\nyou might have to comment out all the other environments defined\nin database.yml while running this task, to leave only the one environment\nyou are working on. It seems sometimes db:setup gets confused and will read\nthe usernames and password fields of entries other than the one specified\nby RAILS_ENV.\nInstalling Ruby on a server without root access\nWhen installing Ruby, rvm will sometimes attempt to execute the commands\non your system to install system packages (such as libyaml-devel, etc).\nIf you're the owner of the system it will prompt you to enter an\nadministrative password for 'yum' or 'apt-get'. However, if you're\non a computer where you only have user access, you can't install\nthese packages yourself. You may have to can ask the syadmins to do it.\nSometimes, like on supercomputer clusters, the packages that rvm wants\nto install are detected as 'missing' by rvm, but their files are still\nperfectly installed and available to you using a command such as module.\nIn that case, if you know quite well that all the file can be found\nwith module, issue the appropriate module load commands then you can\ntrick rvm into not checking the packaging system for missing packages.\nBefore compiling Ruby, edit the file $HOME/.rvm/scripts/functions/build_config\nand find an excerpt that looks like this:\n  rvm_log \"Checking requirements for ${rvm_autolibs_flag_runner}.\"\n  if\n    __rvm_requirements_run ${rvm_autolibs_flag_runner} \"$@\"\n  then\n    rvm_log \"Requirements installation successful.\"\n  else\n\nChange the if condition so that it doesn't invoke the check command at all:\n  rvm_log \"Checking requirements for ${rvm_autolibs_flag_runner}.\"\n  if\n    true\n    #__rvm_requirements_run ${rvm_autolibs_flag_runner} \"$@\"\n  then\n    rvm_log \"Requirements installation successful.\"\n  else\n\nThat way, rvm will always think your system has all the necessary package\nrequirements to proceed. Make sure to undo this change after you've successfully\ncompiled Ruby. \nRuntime Issues\nMysql2 error\nSome SQL queries performed by CBRAIN might fail with a message that contains these keywords:\n(...) incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by (...)\n\nThis happens more and more with modern servers. To fix this you need to change the configuration of the DB server, by removing the keyword ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY from a setting called sql_mode. This sql_mode setting is a list of several keywords separated by commas. There are two ways you can do this:\n\nIn the MySQL global configuration file (generally in /etc/my.cnf). The configuration file sometimes has the sql_mode setting explicitely stated in the [mysqld] section, and sometimes it isn't. If the setting isn't there, you can still create it yourself by first finding out the full value of sql_mode from the database's variable (see next bullet point) and removing ONLY_FULL_GROUP_BY.\nDirectly in the database by changing the content of the \"sql_mode\" variable.\n\n\nif ('UA-XXXXXXXXX-X') {\n\t(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n\t(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n\tm=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n\t})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n\tga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');\n\tga('send', 'pageview');\n}\n\n"},"2-interfaces/Interface-Guides.html":{"url":"2-interfaces/Interface-Guides.html","title":"Interface guides","keywords":"","body":"In this section you will find all the information about the CBRAIN\nweb interface and how to use it.

This section\ndescribes Data Providers and how to create them. CBRAIN supports\ndifferent types of Data Providers, for example SshDataProvider\nand VaultSshDataProvider; they differ in how they structure their\nfiles on their respective storage areas.\nHow to create a Data Provider\n\nGo to the \"Data Providers\" tab.\nOpen the \"Create new Data Provider\" panel.\nFill in the form:\nName: Name of the Data Provider.\nDescription: First line should be a short description, which\nwill be used in the Data Provider table. After that you can add\nany special notes for the users.\nTime Zone: The time zone of the Data Provider\nType: Type of Data Provider - (see below for more\ninformation).\nOwner: The owner of the Data Provider.\nProject: You can limit the access to a Data Provider to\nmembers of a specific project. For more information see the Projects page.\nStatus: The Data Provider can be \"online\" or \"offline\".\nWhen \"offline\", the Data Provider will not be made available\nto users.\nMode: A Data Provider can be \"read/write\" or \"read only\".\nIf it is \"read/write\" users with access to it can write on it,\nbut if it is \"read only\" the users with access to it can just\nread the data stored on it.\nSyncability: Robust synchronization and caching mechanisms\nwere built into the core platform to avoid unnecessary data\ntransfers. The portal and execution servers maintain a local cache\nof the files that have been asynchronously transferred to them.\nSynchronization status for all data in all caches is maintained\nin the metadata database by CBRAIN. Resources will use cached\nversions of files until the version on the Data Provider changes,\nat which point all cached versions will be flagged as invalid.\nResources caching invalid data will simply resynchronize with the\nData Provider upon the next requested data operation. Users can\nmanually trigger cache deletion of their data if desired. A Data\nProvider can be \"Fully syncable\" in this case the synchronization\nmechanisms of CBRAIN are used or \"Not syncable\".\nSSH parameters for remote Data Providers: Fill in this part\nif you configure a SshDataProvider with the Remote Hostname,\nthe Remote Username and finally a Remote Port Number if\nnecessary.\nCloud Storage Configuration: Fill in this part if you\nconfigure cloud storage, such as Amazon S3. In this\ncase you should specify your Client Identifier and Client Token.\nNote: Cloud storage is in the prototyping stage in CBRAIN. It\nis implemented as a proof of concept, but performance and reliability is not guaranteed.\nPhysical data location: With the \"Full Directory Path\" this field is not used for cloud storage.\nOther properties:\nFiles must be copied/moved upon registration, only for browsable Data\nProviders.\nFiles will always be erased upon de-registration, only for browsable Data\nProviders.\nFiles can be browsed only by members of this project, only for browsable\nData Providers.\nCannot be used for uploading files in the file manager.\nFiles cannot be viewed in the file manager, in this case no\nviewer will be available for files on this data provider.\n\n\n\n\nThe Public SSH Key for this CBRAIN Portal for the CBRAIN installation\nis shown in a box, and this need to be installed on the remote host\nfor SSH-based DataProviders (or Smart ones with a SSH personality).\n\nTypes of Data Providers\nThis section describes different types of Data Providers implemented\nin CBRAIN. Not all of them are useful. In production environments,\nthe recommended types are EnCbrainSmartDataProvider for official\ndata storage and SshDataProvider for user-specific personal storage.\n\nLocalDataProvider\nThis is an abstract class which represents Data Providers where the\nremote files are local to the currently running rails application.\nHere, subclasses are not meant to cache anything! The 'remote' files\nare in fact all local, and accessing the 'cached' files means\naccessing the real provider's files. All methods are adjusted so\nthat their behavior is sensible.\nFlatDirSshDataProvider (a.k.a. SshDataProvider)\nThis class provides an implementation for a Data Provider where the\nremote files are accessed through ssh and rsync. The provider's\nfiles are stored in a flat directory, one level deep, directly\nspecified by the object's remote_dir attribute. The file \"hello\"\nis thus stored in a path like this: /remote_dir/hello.\nVaultSshDataProvider\nThis class provides an implementation for a Data Provider where the\nremote files are accessed through ssh and rsync. The provider's\nfiles are stored in a flat directory, two levels deep, directly\nspecified by the object's remote_dir attribute and the user's login\nname. The file \"hello\" of user \"myuser\" is thus stored in a path\nlike this: /remote_dir/myuser/hello.\nVaultLocalDataProvider\nThis class provides an implementation for a Data Provider where the\nremote files are local to the currently running rails application.\nThe provider's files are stored in a flat directory, two levels\ndeep, directly specified by the object's remote_dir attribute and\nthe user's login name. The file \"hello\" of user \"myuser\" is thus\nstored into a path like this: /root_dir/myuser/hello, where\nroot_dir is the data provider's remote_dir (a local directory).\nThis Data Provider does not cache anything! The 'remote' files are\nin fact all local, and accessing the 'cached' files mean accessing\nthe real provider's files. All methods are adjusted so that their\nbehavior is sensible.\nVaultSmartDataProvider\nThis class implements a 'wrapper' Data Provider that acts either\nas a VaultLocalDataProvider or a VaultSshDataProvider depending on\nwhether or not the current hostname matches the value of the attribute\nremote_host. This means that in the case where the current Rails\napplication runs on the same machine as the Data Provider, the\nfaster and more efficient VaultLocalDataProvider will be used.\nIncomingVaultSshDataProvider\nThis class behaves like the VaultSshDataProvider, except that it\nis browsable. When browsing, only the subdirectory named like the\nlogin name of the current user will be visible. It is perfect for\naccessing a jailed remote_dir for incoming content, where users can\nupload files to these subdirectories on other channels.\nIncomingVaultLocalDataProvider\nThis class is exactly like VaultSshDataProvider, but it also has\nthe ability to browse a subdirectory named after a user when calling\nprovider_list_all(user).\nIncomingVaultSmartDataProvider\nThis class implements a 'wrapper' data provider that acts either\nas a IncomingVaultLocalDataProvider or a IncomingVaultSshDataProvider\ndepending on whether or not the current hostname matches the value\nof the attribute remote_host. This means that in the case where the\ncurrent Rails application runs on the same machine as the data\nprovider, the faster and more efficient VaultLocalDataProvider will\nbe used.\nEnCbrain*DataProvider\nThis class includes EnCbrainSshDataProvider, EnCbrainLocalDataProvider,\nand EnCbrainSmartDataProvider. These three providers are enhanced\nvariations of each other that differ in how they transport data.\nHow they store their files is based on the IDs of those files. The path to\na file is uniquely determined by the file's ID. A file named \"hello\" with ID 41233\nwill be stored like this: /root_dir/04/12/33/hello. Such Data\nProviders have the advantage that files can be renamed and reassigned\nto new owners with minimal modifications on the filesystem's\nstructure. The EnCbrain*DataProviders are the officially recommended\ndata providers for production deployment.\nS3DataProvider\nThis class connects to Amazon's S3 cloud storage service. The files\nwill be stored in a bucket named gbrain_{name} where name is the\nname of the Data Provider. Usage of this Data Provider requires\nobtaining an access key and secret token. Do not rename this Data\nProvider if files are registered with it, unless you also rename\nthe bucket!\nReports\nOn the Data Providers index page you can find links to different\nreports: the \"User Access Report\", the \"Transfer Restrictions Report\"\nand the \"Automatic Tabular Report Maker\".

As \nusual, make sure this directory is not shared with anything else and not even used as a \ncache by any other CBRAIN Rails application. If the Bourreau is on the frontend of a \nsupercomputer, then this directory should be on a filesystem visible from all the compute \nnodes of that supercomputer.\nPatterns for filenames to ignore: Enter any particular pattern of filenames to \nignore; typically the '.DSStore'  and the '.*' file are ignored.\nCache Expiration Timeout\n\n\nTool Version Configuration: A tool config can only be created for an existing \nexecution server. So create the execution server first and then \ncreate the associated tool config afterwards. See the section about Tools \nfor more information.\nCluster Management System Configuration:\nType of cluster: The Bourreau schedules tasks on a supercomputer cluster. \nEnter here the type of cluster you have access to on the machine where\nthe Bourreau is installed. Typically, supercomputers have cluster management\nsystems with names like SGE (Sun Grid Engine), Torque or MOAB. UNIX can also be\nselected, in which case no cluster management system is used and the Bourreau simply \nlaunches the tasks as standard UNIX processes.\nPath to shared work directory: Just like for the cache directory, this\nis configured with the full path to an empty directory on the Bourreau side. \nAnd again, it should not be shared with any other resource. This directory is the \nlocation where subdirectories are created for each task launched on this Bourreau. \nIf the Bourreau is on the frontend of a supercomputer, then this directory \nshould be on a filesystem visible from all the compute nodes of that supercomputer.\nDefault queue name: Name od the queue\nExtra 'qsub' options: Extra option for qsub\n\n\nBourreau Workers Configuration:\nNumber of Workers: Configure a small number of worker subprocesses that\nare launched on the Bourreau side to handle the tasks running there. In the original \nplatform there are usually two to four workers for each execution server.\nCheck interval: The interval used by the worker to check for a new task.\nLog destination: Default is good for production can be changed in development.\nLog verbosity: Default is good for production can be changed in development.\n\n\nTask Limits: The task limits can only be defined once the execution server\nis created.

This can be useful for a programmer to replicate the exception and debug the CBRAIN code.\nThere are four different sections on the show page of an exception:\n\nRequest: In this section the information about the request that raised the exception is shown (e.g. the URL, Method and Revision)\nBacktrace: The full backtrace of the exception is shown, which can be helpful for a programmer to find the origin of the exception.\nSession: The information about the session that raised the exception (e.g. the client or user agent).  Sometimes it can be useful in order to reproduce the exception.\nHeaders: This shows information about the HTTP header fields.\n\n\nif ('UA-XXXXXXXXX-X') {\n\t(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n\t(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n\tm=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n\t})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n\tga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');\n\tga('send', 'pageview');\n}\n\n"},"2-interfaces/admin_Reports-And-Monitoring.html":{"url":"2-interfaces/admin_Reports-And-Monitoring.html","title":"Reports and Monitoring","keywords":"","body":"To help the platform administrators, CBRAIN has many reports in different\nlocations, which are not readily visible to the user. This section describe all \nsuch reports. CBRAIN also has a comprehensive mechanism for tracking activity on the platform.\nAutomatic tabular Report maker\nThe \"Report maker\" can generate many different kinds of reports in a tabular\nlayout (e.g. reports about 'UserFile' or 'DataProvider'). This is a modular way\nto generate different reports.\nTo use the \"Report maker\":\n\nGo to \"My Account\" tab.\nClick on \"Report Maker\".\nSelect \"Report type\" in the gray box. Most reports count the number of objects\nthat are accessible, but some of them perform summation of some attributes.\nClick \"Lookup columns and rows\" and the form is adjusted to show which\nattributes can be selected for the rows and columns of the table.\nSelect an attribute for the rows and columns using each of the selection boxes\nshown at the top and left of the table area.\nClick \"Generate report\" and a table is created with hot links to the\nappropriate index pages for the objects.

In each cell there is a color coded chip to\nrepresent the size of the data, from blue to red.\nServer reports\nUser access report\nTo show the \"User Access Reports\":\n\nGo to the \"Servers\" tab.\nClick \"User Access Report\".\n\nThis is a simple table with rows for users and columns for servers. Each cell in\nthe table is a green circle when the user has access to the Data Provider or a\nred cross otherwise.\nDisk cache report\nTo show the \"Disk Cache Report\":\n\nGo to the \"Servers\" tab.\nClick \"Disk Cache Report\".\n\nThis page displays the size of the cache directory by user and server. The size\nof the data is color coded from blue to red. If the user has an active task on a\nparticular server, a red message appears in the cell to inform the administrator.\nA filter can be added to select results by date. Cleanup of the cache can also be\nperformed on this page.\nTask workdir size report\nTo show the \"Task Workdir Size report\":\n\nGo to the \"Servers\" tab.\nClick \"Task Workdir Size Report\".\n\nThis is a custom report with rows for users and columns for servers. Each cell\ncontains the size of the data by user and server, with a hot link with the\n\"Number of tasks\". Follow this hot link to be redirected to the Tasks index page,\nwhere filters can be used to select particular entries. In each cell there is a\ncolor coded chip to represent the size of the data, from blue to red.\nAccess to Data Providers\nTo show the \"Access to Data Providers\" report:\n\nGo to the \"Servers\" tab.\nClick \"Access to Data Providers\".\n\nThis page shows which servers (rows) can access which Data Providers (columns). \nEach cell in the report can show:   \n\nGreen circle (access is allowed)      \nRed cross     \nRed cross and \"no access\"     \nGreen circle and \"no access\"   \nQuestion marks, with or without \"no access\"   \n\nThe report page can be consulted for further information on each of these options.  \n\"No access\" means that within CBRAIN the admin disallowed the connection, \nso servers cannot access files on the Data Provider at all, neither streaming \nnor synchronized, even if the Data Provider seems alive. Number 2 and 3 are \nslightly different, since the red cross means that the transfer is supposedly \nallowed, but when a test is made it still fails for reasons outside of CBRAIN's \ncontrol (e.g. firewall rules).\nTo launch tasks on a particular execution server, they should be \nconfigured to access files on Data Providers marked by green circles.\nIf a Data Provider is identified as \"not syncable\" (below their name), its\nfiles can still be accessed through streaming APIs, but can never be fully\nsynchronized on any server. \nTask statistics\nTask statistics by status\nTo show the \"Task Statistics By Status\" report\n\nGo to the \"Servers\" tab.\nSelect a particular execution server for which you want to show statistics.\nClick \"Task Statistics By Status\".\n\nThis is a custom report with rows for users and columns for number of tasks with a \nparticular status. The table only shows information for the particular execution \nserver that you selected. Every cell contains a hot link; if you click on it you are \nredirected to the Tasks tab, listing all of the tasks with a particular status and \nuser on the execution server.\nTask statistics by type\nTo show the \"Task Statistics By Type\" report\n\nGo to the \"Servers\" tab.\nSelect a particular execution server for which you want to show\nstatistics.\nClick on \"Task Statistics By Type\".\n\nThis is a custom report with rows for users and columns for the number of \ntasks of a particular type. It only shows the information for the particular \nexecution server you selected.

All you need is a web browser  (recent versions of Firefox, Safari or Chrome, Internet Explorer) and you don’t need to install any specialized software.\nGetting started\nGetting an account\nSee your service administrator.\nTypical data workflow in CBRAIN\n\nUpload your files to CBRAIN\nRun a task (e.g. \"Diagnostics\") on your files on CBRAIN\nExamine your processed output files on CBRAIN\nDownload your output files to your computer\n\nTwo Methods for Uploading/Downloading Files in CBRAIN\n\nIf you just have a few files, you can transfer the files one by one using the web browser.\nIf you have many files, you can might find it more convenient to upload them all at once using a SFTP server.\n\nNote: The typical workflow steps in CBRAIN are different depending on which of these two methods you choose, as explained below.\nThis guide explains how to carry out the steps of typical data workflow in the order listed above using either method for transferring files and using \"Diagnostics\" as an example of a task which can be carried out in CBRAIN.\nCreate a project\n\nLogin in to CBRAIN\n\n\nWhen you log on you are sent to a project summary page.  A project is a storage space unit for your files and tasks.  You can either open an existing project by clicking on it or create a new one.\n\nClick on \"Create Project\"\n\nAfter the new project has been created, a list of all projects are shown in \"Button View\".\nProjects are color coded according to whether each project is Personal (blue), Shared (green) or System (red).\nIn this case, the \"Example\" we created is Personal (blue).\n\n\n\n\nUpload files\nData Providers - Network Storage Space: The files in CBRAIN are stored in a \"Data Provider\", which is network storage space for files on a computer. This could be on your own computer or on another computer you connect to using CBRAIN.\nTwo Options for Uploading Files: If you only have a few files to upload, you may find it convenient to upload them one by one, or if you have many files, to upload them all at once.\nUpload files one by one using Web Browser\n\nClick on project you created where you want files to go\n\nClick on \"Upload File\"\n\nSelect files to upload\nYou have the option of uploading zipped (archived) files and extracting them\nThere is a memory limit of 400 MB per file - if you exceed this, use SFTP server\n\nRepeat upload procedure for each file\nContinue until all files have been uploaded to project\n\nUpload files all at once using  SFTP server\nMethod 1: Filezilla or another GUI SFTP Client\nIf you are using Mac, Windows or Linux/Unix Operating systems, we recommend that you use Filezilla or another graphical user interface SFTP Client to transfer files.\n\nInstructions for Filezilla:\nDownload and install Filezilla on your computer\nSelect \"File\" menu, then click on \"Site Manager\"\nSelect \"New Site\"\nUnder \"General Tab\" in \"Site Manager\"\nEnter hostname: See your service administrator\nEnter port number: See your service administrator\nSelect Server Type: SFTP - SSH File Transfer protocol\nSelect Logon Type: NORMAL\nEnter the username and password for your CBRAIN account\n\n\n\nUnder \"Advanced\" tab in \"Site Manager\"\nSelect \"Bypass proxy\"\n\nClick connect\n\n\nFiles on your local computer are listed on the left\nFiles on the remote computer are listed on the right\nFiles may be dragged to move them to and from the remote and local computers\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod 2: Command line\nIt is very convenient to use a graphical user interface SFTP Client as described above.  However, you also have the option of performing these operations at the command line:\n\ncd \nsftp -o port=XXX cbrainuser@xxx.xx (See your service administrator)\nput *.txt\nOptions can be displayed by entering help into the command line\n\nCommon part: Move Files from Temporary Storage SFTP Server to Data Provider\n\nMove Files from Temporary Storage SFTP Server to Data Provider\n\nClick on \"Browse\" to the right of your \"Data Provider\"\n\nYou should see a list of files you already uploaded\nCheck boxes for all files\nIf the file format is not automatically detected correctly (e.g. \"TextFile\"), fix this by selecting the file format with the drop down menu under \"Type\" (click on \"All files as…\").\n\n\n\nMove your files from the temporary server to \"MainStore\":\nClick on \"Register Files\" tab\nChoose project where the files will go (e.g. \"Example\")\nSelect \"Move the files to Data Provider\"\nChoose Data Provider where the files will go (e.g. \"MainStore\")\nClick \"Register the files\"\n\nNote that if you register a large number of files, this can take some time\n\n\n\nStart a task\n\nSelect the project you created\nClick on \"Files\" tab\nIf you don’t want to run a task on all of the files, one method to avoid having to click on each file individually is to search files by name (1), or create a custom filter.\nNote: that the filter will remain in effect until you clear it, so you may think that files are missing if you forget that it is there. If you want to remove the filter, click on \"Clear\" link next to \"Active Filters\".\nSelect all the files you want to run a task on (2)\n\n\nSteps to Start Task:\n\nClick on \"Launch Task\"\nClick on drop down menu list to select a task\nChoose task version and server\nNote: Once you choose a server, you will get a message with approximate time that it might take to start running. You may choose to switch to a different server if the time estimate is too long.\n\nEnter task parameters for \"Diagnostics\"\nYou can select the Data Provider on which the result will be saved (1) in the \"Task Control\" section\nYou can choose some parameters for your task in the \"Task Parameters\" section. You can click on \"Help\" (2) link in \"Task Parameters\" section of window, and there are \"Help\" links like this whenever you launch a task.\nClick \"Start Diagnostics\" (3)\n\nNew task appears\n\n\n\nCheck the progress of a task\n\nCheck back later to see if task completed\n\nTroubleshooting Tip - Check the Log Information: As a task is running log information is generated. If there are red error messages and the task did not complete, check the log information to see what happened.\n\nSteps for Accessing the Log Information:\nClick on \"Projects\" menu, and then the name of project\n\nClick the \"Tasks\" tab\n\nClick on \"Diagnostics\" (name of task) to show log information\n\nScroll down to see log information - the following is an example of part of the log (not all lines are shown).\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother Troubleshooting Tip - Trigger Error Recovery: Usually if a task doesn’t complete, the issue is related to problems with the input files, but occasionally the task may stop because of a server error. If this occurs, one option you have is to restart the task using \"Trigger Error Recovery\". If this does not resolve the issue, the problem is likely with the input files.\n\nSteps for Trigger Error Recovery:\nClick on \"Projects\" menu, then name of project.\nClick on \"Tasks\" tab, then check box to select failed task.\nClick on \"For Failed Tasks\", then \"Trigger Error Recovery\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewing the output of a finished task\n\nClick on \"Diagnostics\" (name of task)\n\nGo to the section \"Parameters\"\nClick on the link after \"Report\"\n\nClick on \"Show Displayable Content\"\n\n\nDownloading processed output files from finished task\nFollow the same procedure you used for uploading files but in reverse. You may find it convenient to download files one by one if you just have a few files, or if you have many files, to download them all at once.\nDownload files one by one using Web Browser\n\nClick on \"Projects\" menu, then click on name of project\nClick on \"Files\" and check box next to file you want to download\n\nClick on \"File Management\" (1)\nEnter the name for downloaded file (2)\nClick on \"Download Files\" (3) - file will download to Downloads folder on your computer\n\n\nDownload files all at once using SFTP Server\n\nCheck boxes for all output files to download (1)\nOr you may find it easy to use the \"Filter\" feature to select just the output files to download\nNote: that you have to click on \"Clear\" next to \"Active Filters\" if you want to clear the filter. If you forget this you might come back later and think that files are missing.\nClick on \"File Management\" (2)\nSelect a SFTP data provider in this case \"SFTP-Brainstorm\" from drop down menu (3)\nClick \"Copy Files\" (4)\n\n\nMethod 1: Filezilla or other GUI interface SFTP client\n\nOpen Filezilla (or other) application\nUse same SFTP settings as before (section (#3.2)), but transfer files in the opposite direction\nDrag/drop files from SFTP-Brainstorm to your computer\n\nMethod 2:  Command line SFTP\nUse commands to change to the right directory and download files:\n\ncd \nsftp -o port=XXX cbrainuser@xxx.xx (See your service administrator)\nget -r *\n\nNote: depending on your system, you may get an error message if you try to download files that haven’t been archived using get -r *. If this is the case,  go to \"File Management\", and click on\n\"(Un)Archive\" to archive files. This is a toggle switch, meaning that if a file is unarchived it will archive it, and vice versa. Once archived, copy it to the SFTP server. Then do the following:\n\ncd \nsftp -o port=XXX cbrainuser@xxx.xx (See your service administrator)\nget /.tar.gz\n\nCommon part: Delete your data from the temporary storage SFTP Server\n\nClick on \"Resources\" and drop down menu to \"Data Providers\"\n\nClick on \"Browse\" to right of your Data Provider (e.g. SFTP-Brainstorm)\n\nCheck boxes for all files that you want to delete and click \"Delete Files\"\n\n\nOptional advanced feature of CBRAIN\nData Provider Configured on User’s Computer\": This manual describes two different options for uploading/downloading files, either using the web browser or SFTP Server. There is in fact a third option for advanced users, which is to use a Data Provider on your own computer, which makes it easier to transfer files. If you wish to use this option, see your service administrator\nHelp and technical support\nMethods for Getting Help:\n\nThere are \"Help\" buttons at many places on the on-line system.\nFor descriptions of different tools and their parameters, go to \"Resources\" menu and click on \"Tools\".\nThere is a \"Help\" screen for a particular task, whenever you launch a new task.\nIf you have any questions about using CBRAIN or comments on this guide, you can email support:\ncbrain-support.mni at mcgill.ca.\n\nCitation\nIf you use CBRAIN to process data, please cite the following publication:\nSherif T, Rioux P, Rousseau M-E, Kassis N, Beck N, Adalat R, Das S, Glatard T and Evans AC (2014) CBRAIN: a web-based, distributed computing platform for collaborative neuroimaging research.

Here you will find general information\nabout setting up a work environment, and information on how \nyou can contribute to CBRAIN.\nHere is a simplified diagram of the main ActiveRecord models of CBRAIN:\n\nNote: Some models of CBRAIN are not represented in this simplified diagram.\nThis is the case for:\n\nAll subclasses of DataProviders (VaultSmartDataProvider, SshDataProvider, LocalDataProvider, etc.)\nAll subclasses of Users (AdminUser, SiteManager, NormalUser)\nSome isolated subclasses (ActiveRecordLog, MetaDataStore, SanityCheck)\n\nA complete diagram can be generated using RailRoady.\nSetting up a development environment\n\nFirst, use a Mac or a Linux workstation for software development. \nCreate an empty directory where you will install the CBRAIN code base, \nand follow the instructions in the Setup Guide. In there you will \nfind a section with more specific instructions about getting your \npersonal CBRAIN system operational (including a local Execution Server).\n\nSecond, become familiar with Ruby, and Ruby On Rails.  There are\nmany good books and online resources to explain to you the\nbasics of MVC (Model View Controller) programming, and they will\nalso explain to you the role and typical location of all files in\nthe code tree.\nCBRAIN uses the \"Rails 3.2-Stable\" branch of Rails running under\nRuby 2.0 or better. A newer version of Rails is available (Rails 4), \nbut the codebase needs extensive modifications to get it running \nunder that version, and this will only happen in a future\nrelease.\n\nThird, create the code documentation. Once you have installed\nthe code base, a bash script at the top level called \"alldoc.sh\"\nwill do this for you. It invokes the 'rdoc' utility\n(http://rdoc.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html)\nand will create a bunch of local HTML files that you can then access\nwith your local browser. This is the ultimate source of documentation\nfor the APIs!\n\n\nList of subguides\nStyle\nThe Programming Style guide will get you acquainted with\nthe conventions we use for contributing code to CBRAIN.\nUserfiles and CbrainTasks\nIf you are not planning to develop on the platform itself, but\nsimply want to contribute by creating new CbrainTasks or\nUserfiles (which are deployed as plugins,\nthere are separate guides to help you learn about these, the\nCbrainTask Programmer Guide and the Userfile Programmer Guide.\nLogging and provenance\nOf common interest to all programmers are the CBRAIN libraries\nthat provide detailed logging for all ActiveRecord objects,\nincluding facilities for recording GIT commit numbers of the\ncode that is being run. This is how data provenance and tracking\nof modifications is performed within CBRAIN, linking data files\nto tasks, etc. The APIs are described in Logging And Provenance.\nMetaData\nCBRAIN provides a generic way to associate arbitrary key-value\npairs to any ActiveRecord objects. This API is described in the\nMetaData manual.\nExternal APIs\nFor programmers who want to use an external application or script instead\nof a browser to interact with a CBRAIN platform, it is possible to do so\nwith an API.  In fact, THREE external APIs are available: one in \nRuby, one in Perl, and one in Javascript. Consult the External APIs manual \nfor information about these APIs.\nTesting suite\nCBRAIN comes with a testing suite. Not all of the capabilities of\nCBRAIN are covered by the tests, but it is a good idea to run it from\ntime to time. We plan to update and improve it continually.\nMore information on this can be found in Testing Suite.\nContributing your code\nIf you would like to contribute code to CBRAIN, then the procedure\nto follow is very simple:\n\nIf you have developed your own Userfile or CbrainTask, that\ndoes not already exist elsewhere, then it is not necessary to contact \nus. As long as you package them in the proper Plugins Structure,\nanybody will be able to extract your code directly in their own\nCBRAIN installation, run a rake task, and start using them. They\ndo not necessarily have to be added to the base platform.\n\nIf you want to contribute bug fixes or platform enhancements,\nthen proceed in the usual GitHub way: have your modifications\nready in a separate fork of the CBRAIN GitHub repository,\nand make a pull request to the ACEs developers in charge.\nWe will evaluate the code, and maybe ask for some modifications,\nand once we are ready, we will merge it to the master branch.\nThe process is described at the GitHub website.\n\n\nAsking for help\nThe CBRAIN team is fully aware that the documention is incomplete\nand imperfect; if you need coding help, consider sending us an email\nmessage with, as much as possible, the clearest and simplest explanation\nof what you need to know. Provide a simple code excerpt if necessary.\nWe do NOT guarantee that we will reply to any message, but making your\nquestion clear and to the point will help us to provide a reply. \nOur email address is cbrain-support.mni@mcgill.ca.\n\nif ('UA-XXXXXXXXX-X') {\n\t(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n\t(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n\tm=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n\t})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n\tga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');\n\tga('send', 'pageview');\n}\n\n"},"3-programmer/Programming-Style.html":{"url":"3-programmer/Programming-Style.html","title":"Programming style","keywords":"","body":"As the CBRAIN system is now open-source, it is time to agree on some\ncommon coding guidelines. Fortunately, Ruby already has a rather strong \ndefault style that is more or less internationally adopted, unlike many \nother programming languages.\nCommonly accepted rules\nSomeone has already written a nice guide. Although it was\nwritten for people developing standalone Ruby applications, many\nof the guidelines apply to us too, Rails developers. Read this\ndocument, but skip the sections that only mostly apply to standalone\napplications (Benchmarking, Profiling, Unit Testing etc):\nhttp://www.caliban.org/ruby/rubyguide.shtml\nThe most important common style rules are basically:\n\nUse an indentation of two spaces, like this:\n\nclass Abc\n  def Xyx\n    if condition\n      do this\n    else\n      print this\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n\nUse the Ruby and Rails convention for identifiers:\n\nSomeClassName\ndef some_method\nsome_variable = \"Hi\"\n\n\n\nCBRAIN-specific rules\nThe following are our internal rules:\nNo tab characters inside code\nDo not leave TAB (ASCII 0x09) characters inside the source code. You can still use the\ntab key, but make sure that you configure your editor such that the tab\ncharacters themselves are replaced by normal spaces. All modern\neditors have this option, so figure out how to set this preference\nin your editor. In 'vim', this is done by adding the command \"set\nexpandtab\" in your .vimrc.\nComment your Ruby code with the RDOC conventions\nAnnotate your classes and methods using the rdoc conventions.\nThis will allow you and other programmers to generate nice searchable\nHTML pages for your code by calling the rake commands:\n\nrake doc:brainportal   (in the BrainPortal subdir) --> main index in Brainportal/doc/brainportal/index.html\nrake doc:bourreau      (in the Bourreau subdir) --> main index in Bourreau/doc/bourreau/index.html\n\nOpen these with your browser. It may be helpful to bookmark them. Remember\nto regenerate these documents from time to time, whenever the\ncode is updated.  An explanation of rdoc is available here:\nhttp://rdoc.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html\n(Look at the section entitled \"Markup\").\nKeep your lines relatively short, if possible\nDo not write lines that are too long and consistently fold over to\nthe other line in your editor. Once in a while it cannot be helped,\nbut often it is possible to split long lines into a more elegant\ntwo line layout. Just be careful WHERE you split it, though,\nas Ruby is particular about interpreting newlines characters as\nstatement terminators (unlike Perl and Java and C, which require\na semicolon). It is best to use a text editor window configured to\nbe between 90 and 100 characters wide.\nAs examples, assume the following three lines are too long (they\nare not all too long, in fact, but this is just an example) and you would like\nto split them a little:\nself.addlog(\"Using Scir for '#{drm}' version '#{version}'\")\nraise \"Error: file does not exist: #{localpath}\" unless File.exists?(localpath)\nproviders = self.find(:all, :conditions => { :online => true, :read_only => false })\n\nThis could be done this way:\nself.addlog(\"Using Scir for '#{drm}' \" +\n            \"version '#{version}'\")\nraise \"Error: file does not exist: #{localpath}\" unless\n    File.exists?(localpath)\nproviders = self.find(:all, :conditions =>\n                            { :online => true, :read_only => false }\n                     )\n\nNote that the continuation line is indented compared to the beginning\nof the statement; the indentation is chosen to be 'pretty'. Also note\nthat the 'unless' keyword MUST be left at the end of the first line\nfor the second example, otherwise Ruby would execute the raise\nstatement unconditionally:\nraise \"Error: file does not exist: #{localpath}\" # WRONG!\n  unless File.exists?(localpath)                 # WRONG!\n\nConfigure your editor to remove trailing white spaces\nPlease do not insert or leave trailing white spaces after your lines of code.\nMost editors can be configured to automatically strip such spaces, or at least\nhighlight it for you. Committing files that have changed only in that new\ntrailing white space is added is wrong.\nConfigure your editor to make sure the last line of a file ends with a Newline\nSome editors, by default, strip the last newline character at the end of the last\nline of code (assuming it is not a blank line, obviously). Make sure your editor\ndoes NOT do that.\nNote: Original author of this document is Pierre Rioux, way back in 2009\n\nif ('UA-XXXXXXXXX-X') {\n\t(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n\t(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n\tm=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n\t})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n\tga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');\n\tga('send', 'pageview');\n}\n\n"},"3-programmer/cbrain-task/CbrainTask-Programmer-Guide.html":{"url":"3-programmer/cbrain-task/CbrainTask-Programmer-Guide.html","title":"CbrainTask an Userfile Programmer Guide","keywords":"","body":"This document describes the CBRAIN task architecture, and how to\ncode new tasks. Tasks are the data structures that track and control\nthe transfer of data files to an execution server, and the submission\nof a script or program to process them.\nCBRAIN architecture\nAs explained in the Setup Guide, CBRAIN is organized as two\ndifferent Rails applications, one for the web-facing side (BrainPortal)\nand one for the execution server-facing side (Bourreau). This\ndistinction allows us to compartmentalize the CbrainTasks into a\nclass hierarchy that is different, depending on which side it is\non.\nLet us examine one of the CbrainTask that is provided with the\nstandard CBRAIN distribution.\n\"Diagnostics\" is a task launched by a CBRAIN administrator which\nchecks different properties of a CBRAIN installation (like whether\nor not files get transferred properly, or jobs launched on the\nclusters, etc.).\nThe actual Ruby class of the diagnostics task is \"CbrainTask::Diagnostics\".\nThis string ends up in the \"type\" column of the \"cbrain_tasks\" table of the\nRails database. CBRAIN uses Rails' \"single table inheritance\", so whenever one\nrow of that table is loaded as an object, the type of the object will be\ndetermined by the value of the \"type\" column.\nBrainPortal class hierarchy\nOn the BrainPortal Rails application, all task objects recreated\nfrom the database will inherit from another class \"PortalTask\",\nwhich inherits from \"CbrainTask\", which then inherits from \"ActiveRecord::Base\":\nActiveRecord::Base This allows us to store methods at three different levels of the class hierarchy:\n\nMethods that apply to all tasks are in CbrainTask\nMethods that apply to all tasks on the BrainPortal Rails app are in PortalTask\nMethods that are specific to all CbrainTask::Diagnostics are in there.\n\nIn particular, the PortalTask class will contain utility methods\nand helpers to provide for the task's life cycle as a web interface\nobject.\nBourreau class hierarchy\nA similar situation happens on the Bourreau Rails application. This\ntime it is another, different class that is between the task and\nthe CbrainTask class:\nActiveRecord::Base In this case, the ClusterTask class will contain utility methods\nand helpers that apply to ongoing situations as the task is\nbeing processed on the Execution Server.\nCode organization\nThe files that comprise a single CBRAIN task are packaged in a\nsubdirectory with a specific structure. For the Diagnostics task,\nas distributed with the platform, we can see five files spread across a\nstructure two directories deep:\ndiagnostics/portal/diagnostics.rb\ndiagnostics/bourreau/diagnostics.rb\ndiagnostics/views/_show_params.html.erb\ndiagnostics/views/_task_params.html.erb\ndiagnostics/views/public/edit_params_help.html\nThe first four of this list are mandatory. They consist of two Ruby\nmodel files, one for the BrainPortal side and one for the Bourreau\nside, and two Rails view partials (under a subdirectory called\nviews).\nportal/taskname.rb\nThe model file under the portal/ subdirectory is where the task\nprogrammer adds the methods necessary to implement the task's web\ninterface and initialization. Those methods include callbacks that\nwill be invoked by the CBRAIN framework when the task is created, its\nparameter page is rendered or edited, it is officially\nsaved in the database, and it us ready to be launched.\nThe class and instance methods that a programmer typically needs to provide are:\nself.default_launch_args()\nself.pretty_params_names()\nbefore_form()\nrefresh_form()\nafter_form()\nfinal_task_list()\nafter_final_task_list_saved(task_list)\nuntouchable_params_attributes()\nunpresetable_params_attributes()\nbourreau/taskname.rb\nThe model file under the bourreau/ subdirectory is where the task\nprogrammer adds the methods necessary to implement the task's\nlife cycle on the execution server.\nThe methods that a programmer typically needs to provide are:\nsetup()                         # mandatory\ncluster_commands()              # mandatory\nsave_results()                  # mandatory\njob_walltime_estimate()\nrecover_from_setup_failure()\nrecover_from_cluster_failure()\nrecover_from_post_processing_failure()\nrestart_at_setup()\nrestart_at_cluster()\nrestart_at_post_processing()\nView partials\nThe files views/_task_params.html.erb and views/_show_params.html.erb\n(whose names are constant) provide the rendering of the task's\ncustom elements in the CBRAIN web page. The first is the content\nof a form where the user can enter the parameters of a new task.\nIt will be rendered during the new or update actions of Rail's\ntasks_controller. The second is a status page showing some information\nabout a task that already exists on the system.\nCbrainTask attributes\nMost of the ActiveRecord attributes are rather self-explanatory.\nHere are a few that may need some explanation:\n\n:batch_id\nWhen several related CbrainTasks are created all at the same, they \nwill all share the same :batch_id; this number is usually the same \nas the ID of one of the tasks in the batch, often the one with the \nlowest ID (although this is not guaranteed).\n\n:cluster_jobid\nThe identifier string used on the cluster side to identify the\njob on the clustering system. This attribute can be empty if the\ntask's code is run by another task, for instance a parallelizer.\n\n:cluster_workdir\nThe basename of the private work directory where the task's code\nis being run on the cluster side. The ClusterTask class has\nnumerous methods to handle reconstructing the full pathname to\nthis directory, creating it, archiving it, etc.\n\n:params\nA serialized hash table containing the private custom parameters\nfor this task. The layout and content of this hash is arbitrary\nand is specified by the task's programmer.\n\n:status\nA set of strings from a controlled vocabulary, tracking the state\nof the task during its lifecycle see Task life cycle below).\nThe full set of possible values can be obtained from\nconstants stored in the Ruby class CbrainTask.\n\n:bourreau_id and :tool_config_id\nThese two IDs point to other ActiveRecords models. :bourreau_id\nis a link to a Bourreau object (in the remote_resources table),\nwhich represents the execution server associated with this task.\n:tool_config_id is a link to a ToolConfig object, which stores\ninformation specific to a particular version of the tool that the\nCbrainTask implements.\nOne thing to observe is that these two objects encode some redundant\ninformation: the ToolConfig object also contains its own :bourreau_id\nattribute, which must be in sync. This is an unfortunate feature\nleftover from CBRAIN's history.\n\n:prerequisites\nA serialized hash table encoding the dependencies that this task\nhas on other tasks. For more information see the\nCbrainTask Prerequisites document.\n\n:share_wd_tid\nThe ID of another CbrainTask; this is used when the current task\nis configured NOT to have its own private work directory on the\ncluster, but instead to use the work directory of that other task.\n\n:run_number\nA number, starting at 1, and increasing every time the task is\nrestarted by the user after a successful previous run. It can be\nused by the task programmers to differentiate the outputs of\nslightly different runs of the task, for instance when parameters\nhave changed.\n\n:level and :rank\nThese two numbers are optional and are used by the interface (in\nparticular by the task index page) to show the list of tasks\nordered and indented within a batch of tasks.\n\n:results_data_provider_id\nThis attribute is available for a task programmer to know on which\nDataProvider to create the results files, when the task completes\nsuccessfully.\n\n:workdir_archived and :workdir_archive_userfile_id\nThese two attributes are used by the task archiving mechanism to\ntrack whether or not the task's work directory has been archived,\nand if so, whether the archive was left on the cluster or saved\nback in CBRAIN as a user file.\n\n\nTask life cycle\nCbrainTasks are standard Rails ActiveRecord objects. On the BrainPortal\nside, they are created and edited using an almost standard Rails\naction sequence.\nTask creation\nThe following diagram shows the interactions between the controller\nactions, the views and partial rendered, and the callback methods\nimplemented by the CbrainTask programmer in the model.\n\nThere are a few non-standard paths:\n\nWhile the form for a task is being presented to a user, if the\nuser clicks on a submit button that contains the word 'Refresh',\nthe form's data will be sent back to the create action, which\nwill invoke the model's refresh_form() method, and then render again\nthe web form instead of creating the object. Note that the presence\nof that 'Refresh' button is optional and is a design choice made\nby the task programmer when designing the task's interface.\n\nThe tasks_controller's create action can in fact create an\nentire array of CbrainTask objects in the database; the form's data\nis usually interpreted as a template for such arrays, and the task\nprogrammer is free to supply to the action a single task object,\nor an array of objects. This is performed by the final_task_list()\nmethod of the CbrainTask.\n\nThere are numerous special features of the create action that\nare not shown in this diagram; for instance, once an array of tasks\nhas been prepared and saved, it is possible for the action to create\nspecial CbrainTask::Parallelizer\ntasks to regroup them in batches that are going to be run in parallel.\n\n\nTask editing\nThe following diagram shows what happens when tasks are edited.\nTasks can only be edited while their status are stable (Completed,\nTerminated, etc).\n\nOnce again, there are a few non-standard features in the paths.\n\nThe 'refresh' button feature is again available, just like when\ncreating a task.\n\nThe 'status' attribute of a task cannot be edited; instead there\nare special controller actions implemented to allow a task to be\nrestarted, terminated, etc.\n\n\nStandard life cycle diagram\nThe following diagram shows the standard state diagram of a CbrainTask.\nThe content of the boxes correspond to the values of the :status\nattribute of the CbrainTask object.\n\nOnce a CbrainTask object has been saved in the database by the\nBrainPortal side, there is almost no other operation that is performed\nthere. The rest of the life cycle is handled by the Bourreau side,\nand most of them by the daemons running there, known as BourreauWorkers.\nThe workers pick CbrainTasks objects from the databases, one at a\ntime, and proceed to run their setup code (provided by the task's\nprogrammer), monitor the jobs on the supercomputer side, and save\nthe results of the tasks (also according to the custom methods added\nby the task's programmer).\nGetting started\nThe simplest way to get started is to follow the steps of the\nNew Task Tutorial. This will demonstrate many features of the CbrainTask\nAPIs in CBRAIN.\nAdvanced features\nCbrainTasks are usually designed with a very simple execution model:\nthey are meant to read some input files, execute a program on them,\nand create some output files. Keeping tasks simple allows the\ndevelopers to use them in a more complex system, either automatically\nor with a little bit of simple programming using these CBRAIN\nfeatures:\nTask restartability and recovery\n  Task are not normally restartable once they have completed\n  successfully. They are also normally dead and cannot be restarted if they have failed.\n  But this is just a conservative default behavior.\n  A task's programmer simply has to add a few callback methods to\n  tell the CBRAIN framework that the task is indeed restartable or\n  can recover from failure.  This includes adding some custom cleanup\n  or preparation code. Once done, the user will be able to restart\n  successful tasks at three different points in the life cycle, or\n  trigger some error recovery code if it has failed.\n  Task restartability and recovery is described in a separate\n  document, CbrainTask Recovery And Restart.\nAutomatic parallelization\n  Several simple tasks can be automatically run in parallel by\n  using a separate CBRAIN Parallelizer task. The parallelizer\n  will be the only job launched on the cluster, and it will\n  run all the other tasks' code. Programmers can code this\n  themselves, or make their simple task automatically parallelizable\n  so that the system administrator can decide if and when to\n  parallelize them when deploying them.\n  The mechanism is explained in a separate document,\n  CbrainTask::Parallelizer.\nTask dependencies\n  Tasks can be made to depend on other tasks.\n  The task dependency mechanism is explained in a separate document,\n  CbrainTask Prerequisites.\nTasks sharing a work directory\n  Each task has, by default, a private work directory created for it.\n  But a set of tasks can be made to share a single work directory if\n  this is more convenient for a particular processing application.\n  The mechanism is described in a separate document,\n  CbrainTask SharedWorkDir.\nNote: Original author of this document is Pierre Rioux\n\nif ('UA-XXXXXXXXX-X') {\n\t(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n\t(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n\tm=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n\t})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n\tga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');\n\tga('send', 'pageview');\n}\n\n"},"3-programmer/Plugins-Structure.html":{"url":"3-programmer/Plugins-Structure.html","title":"Plugins Structure","keywords":"","body":"Within CBRAIN, the model files for Userfiles and CbrainTasks are not stored in the traditional Rails location, the app/models directory. Instead, a 'plugin' structure has been designed where those Userfiles and CbrainTasks are stored. The advantage of this approach is that the main CBRAIN framework can be updated and maintained separately from these models.\nSpecification of a plugin package\nWithin the CBRAIN code branch, the plugins are deployed in:\n/path/to/BrainPortal/cbrain_plugins\nTwo subdirectories located within that subdirectory contain the default distribution:\n/path/to/BrainPortal/cbrain_plugins/installed-plugins\n/path/to/BrainPortal/cbrain_plugins/cbrain-plugins-base\n\"installed-plugins\"\nThe first of these subdirectories, 'installed-plugins', is an administrative \nsubdirectory where plugins are 'installed' by rake tasks. \nBasically, its content is populated by a set of UNIX \nsymbolic links with relative paths to the real files of the plugins. Usually, there\nwould be no reason for programmers or administrators to change anything there. It \ncan usually be left alone.\n\"your-plugin-package-name\" (e.g. \"cbrain-plugins-base\")\nThe second of these subdirectories, 'cbrain-plugins-base', is a complete example \nof a 'plugin package', and contains the default set of Userfiles and \nCbrainTasks that come with the default installation. A quick inspection of its\ncontent show that a 'plugin package' contains two subdirectories, one for \nUserfiles and one for CbrainTasks:\ncbrain-plugins-base/userfiles\ncbrain-plugins-base/cbrain_task    # singular, for historical reasons :-(\nAgain, within each of these two subdirectories will be another level\nof subdirectories, one per Userfiles (under userfiles/) and one per\nCbrainTask (under cbraintask/).\nThis structure allows a scientific programmer to distribute, as a\ncomplete 'plugin package', a full set of Userfiles and CbrainTask\nthat logically go together. As an example, assume a programmer wants\nto add a plugin package for a set of neurology tools and userfiles. \nAssuming the package is on GitHub as \"aces/cbrain-plugins-neuro\", the\nprogrammer can simply issue these commands:\n    cd /path/to/BrainPortal/cbrain_plugins\n    git clone https://github.com/aces/cbrain-plugins-neuro.git   # will create 'cbrain-plugins-neuro/' here\n\nThe rest of the installation steps are outside the scope of this document, but\nsuffice to say this simple git clone command has installed most of the files\ncleanly and efficiently.\nStructure of a Userfile plugin\nTo write.\nStructure of a CbrainTask plugin\nTo write.\nRails Generator for CbrainTask\nCBRAIN comes with a Rails generator to help programmers create new\nCbrainTasks.

These features include task version support,\ninput fields, task form refresh, data provenance logging and static\nassets.\nPrerequisites\nTo run this tutorial, you need to install and configure a local,\npersonal copy of a CBRAIN BrainPortal Rails application, make sure\nit is working in 'development' mode, and install and configure a\nBourreau Rails application. The instructions on how to do this are\nprovided in the Setup Guide.\nWhat the task does\nWe create a task to run a UNIX checksum program on a file. The exact\ncommand that we run is the old, classic \"cksum\" program. It is\ninstalled by default on both Linux and Mac OS operating systems and\nworks the same way on both.\nHowever, to make the example more interesting and show some of\nCBRAIN's capabilities, the following additional features are included:\n\nMultiple 'versions' of the program are supported (even though there is actually only one version\nof 'cksum'), each with their own special incompatible parameters. This shows that a CbrainTask\ncan encapsulate multiple versions of a scientific tool.\nThe output of 'cksum' is saved in a report, which is a plain text file, back into the CBRAIN\nuser's file manager.\nMeta data about the task and the files is stored.\nProvenance information is logged (for instance, which file was used or created by which task).\nA rich user interface validates the input that the user provides.\n\nRunning the generator\nThere are about a dozen files that are created and installed for\nthis single example of a CbrainTask. Although these files can be\ncreated manually at the correct locations in the CBRAIN source tree,\nit is better to run the Rails CbrainTask Generator, which creates\ntemplates for most of them:\ncd /path/to/BrainPortal\nrails generate cbrain_task my_cksum\nrake cbrain:plugins:clean:all\nrake cbrain:plugins:install:all\n\nThe files that are created contain information about the kind of\ncode they should contain, but in this tutorial we will ignore this\nand only show the minimum amount of code necessary to accomplish\nour goals.\nIf you rename the task's files, or even just the directory where\nthey are contained, remember to rerun the two rake tasks listed\nabove. This is necessary to adjust the symbolic links that configure\nthe task as 'installed'.\nEditing the portal-side model\nAfter you run the generator above, you should now have a file called\n'.../MyCksum/portal/my_cksum.rb'.  Let's add the methods needed to\nimplement its web interface within the body of the class.\nThe default params\nA task has a params hash where its parameters are stored. We can\nprovide a default value for all the params by creating a class\nmethod named 'default_launch_args'.\n    def self.default_launch_args\n      {\n        # all params are strings if they are shown in the web page\n        :output_file_prefix  => \"ck_\",\n        :an_odd_number       => \"7\",    # shows in form if we run version 2.0.0 or greater\n        :struct_with_day_and_month => {\n          :day   => 3,\n          :month => 'Jan',\n        }\n      }\n    end\n\nNote that the input file(s) on which we run the cksum program are\nnot stored there.  We have only created three parameters:\n\n:output_file_prefix is a prefix added to the filenames of the output reports.\n:an_odd_number is a number that must be odd and is only needed with version 2.0.0\nof cksum (this is necessary to configure versions 1.0.0 and 2.0.0 of the task).\n:struct_with_day_and_month is exactly what it is named and shows that arbitrary structures\ncan be stored in the params, which are referred to in the task's form.\n\nPretty names for the parameters\nWhenever we edit or create a new task, we have the option of adding\na \"pretty name\" to any parameter that appears on the web page. It\nis used when Rails presents a validation error message. Pretty names\nare provided by a method returning a hash with the names. The keys\nare encoded using the Rails convention for parameters; for instance,\ncompare this to the default_launch_args() above and see how we\nrepresent the :struct_with_day_and_month.\n    def self.pretty_params_names\n      {\n        :output_file_prefix                => 'prefix for the reports',\n        :an_odd_number                     => 'odd number',\n        \"struct_with_day_and_month[day]\"   => \"day of month\",\n        \"struct_with_day_and_month[month]\" => \"month name\",\n      }\n    end\n\nbefore_form()\nThis is the main callback method that most programmers want to fill.\nIt is invoked before the form is rendered and shown to the user\n(thus the method's name). This can be used to validate the list of\nfiles that the user has selected. In our example, we simply make\nsure that all the files are \"SingleFile\"s (i.e. that they are simple\nfiles, not directories, which are instead registered as subclasses\nof \"FileCollection\").\n    def before_form\n      ids = self.params[:interface_userfile_ids].presence || [] # an array of IDs\n      numfound = SingleFile.where(:id => ids).count # ActiveRecord makes sure the subclasses match\n      cb_error \"All selected files must be simple files.\" if numfound != ids.size\n      return \"\" # all ok\n    end\n\nThe method can optionally return a string with a message (which\ndoes not prevent the form from rendering, but the message itself\nis shown). In our example, the empty string is returned, which means\neverything is okay.\nrefresh_form()\nWe allow the user to perform several cycles of refreshing the form.\nControl returns to the model by way of the refresh_form() method,\nwhere the month name is reset to a random month.  This illustrates\na particular capability of the framework, though it may be not very\nuseful for simple tasks.\n    def refresh_form\n      random_month = [ 'Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr' ].sample\n      self.params[:struct_with_day_and_month][:month] = random_month\n      \"\"  # all OK\n    end\n\nThis refresh mechanism is invoked whenever the user clicks on a\n\"submit\" button that contains the keyword \"refresh\" (case insensitive)\nin its label. These types of buttons are not normally shown in the\nCBRAIN task interface, but here one is added once the view partials\nare written (see below).\nafter_form()\nThis method is invoked after the user clicks the \"Submit Task\"\nbutton at the bottom of the form.\nThis is the perfect time to make sure all parameters for the task\nare appropriate and valid. Validation of parameters can be performed\nin the same way as the validation of ActiveRecord attributes, with\ncallbacks to custom validation methods, but it can also be performed\nat this point. If a parameter has a wrong value, adding an error\nmessage to the special error handler for params called params_errors()\nprevents the task from being submitted and the form is shown again\nto the user to allow him to fix the problem.\nIn our example, we make sure that the number entered in the input\nfield for the parameter :an_odd_number is really an odd number. You\ncan check that this validation occurs correctly by entering an even\nnumber and making sure that the form returns with the field highlighted\nin red.\nNote that, as a demonstration of how code can be made conditional\non a particular version of a tool, this validation is made only if\nthe version of 'cksum' is at least \"2.0.0\" (later, two dummy versions,\n1.0.0 and 2.0.0, are configured as an example - see below).\n    def after_form\n      return \"\" unless self.tool_config.is_at_least_version(\"2.0.0\")\n      odd_num = params[:an_odd_number].presence\n      if odd_num.blank? || (odd_num.to_i % 2 != 1)\n        params_errors.add(:an_odd_number, \"is not odd, please enter an odd number.\")\n      end\n      params_error.add(:output_file_prefix, \"must be a simple prefix with no spaces\") unless\n          params[:output_file_prefix] =~ /^\\w+$/\n      \"\" # all ok\n    end\n\nFor more information about the validation and error mechanism\nprovided by CBRAIN for parameters, see the description for the class\nCbrainTaskFormBuilder (in the CBRAIN code documentation).\nfinal_task_list()\nOnce a task's parameters have been submitted, the programmer can\nuse the information to launch not just one task, but an entire array\nof similar tasks. This is the method that returns an array of the\nreal tasks that are launched.\nInvoked on the task object, it should return an array of clones (or\nin fact, duplicates) of the object, differing in one or a few\nparameters. The default behavior is a method in PortalTask that\nreturns simply an array with a single element, the object itself,\nwhich means that normally no arrays of tasks are ever created.\nFor our example, however, a new task is created for each input file\nselected by the user; each of the new task objects is identical to\nthe original task object, except the list of Userfile IDs contains\na single ID. If the user selects 50 files, the end result is to\ncreate 50 distinct tasks.\n    def final_task_list\n      ids = self.params[:interface_userfile_ids]\n      tasklist = []\n      ids.each do |id|\n         newtask = self.dup  # duplicate the whole task\n         newtask.params[:interface_userfile_ids] = [ id ] # replace the list by a new one with a single ID\n         tasklist \nEditing the common model\nThe file '.../MyCksum/common/my_cksum.rb' is a place where you can\nput code that is common to both the BrainPortal side and Bourreau\nside of CBRAIN. In our example, we simply create a version comparison\nclass method. This method makes it possible to invoke some methods on the\ntask's 'tool_config' association, and to quickly check if the\nparticular version of the task selected by the user has support for\na particular feature. In our example, we pretend that if we are\nrunnning version \"1.0.0\" of CkSum, we do not need the odd number\nin the params page and if we are running version \"2.0.0\" we need\nit.\n    def self.compare_versions(v1,v2)\n      v1.to_s  v2.to_s  # very dummy: we just compare the strings\n    end\n\nA proper implementation for a real task would, of course, compare\nthe version strings based on the conventions used by the tool's\ndeveloper (e.g. \"1.2.3\", \"A123\", or \"17.4-gamma\").\nCreating the view files\nWe have two view files to create; these are pretty standard Rails partials.\n_task_params.html.erb\nThis partial contains the body of the form where the task's parameters\nare entered. While writing it, we have access to @task to represent\nthe task object, @tool_config to represent the tool version selected\nby the user and 'form' which is the Rails form handler for the\nobject.\nWe do not create input elements for the basic attributes of the\nActiveRecord CbrainTask, but instead for the parameters of the task,\nwhich are stored as a hash table 'params' (however, this is a true\nreal attribute of CbrainTask). To help design the form, Cbrain\nprovides a set of helper methods to create the input elements. See\nthe class CbrainTaskFormBuilder for more information.\n     \"all\" %>\n    \n    \n    \n    \n       \n       \n       \n    \n    \n    Day:   \n    Month: \n    \n    \n\nNote that this view code demonstrates several other special features\nof the CBRAIN framework:\n\nIt shows how to refer to some static assets that the task parameter page needs (in\nour example, a stylesheet which is used to style the div element at the bottom).\nIt shows how to make part of the form appear or disappear depending on\nthe version of the tool that was selected by the user. This is why the method\ncompare_version() was needed in common.rb, as configured above.\nA special submit button is added that adds the ability to refresh the form and get a\nnew month to be populated in the params automatically via the refresh_form() method.\n\n_show_params.html.erb\nNormally, this file is used to show the user a summary of the\nparameters for the task, once it has been created. In our example,\nit just echoes back all the values in a very simple manner, including\na link to the input file, and a link to the output report (which\nis stored as an ID by the Bourreau side, as will be shown later).\n    Input: \n    Output prefix: \n    \n      Odd number: \n    \n    Day: \n    Month: \n    \n    Output: \n\nThe optional stylesheet\nAs explained above, some static assets are installed just to\ndemonstrate how they can be packaged with the task. In our example,\nit is necessary to create a file 'cksum.css' under 'views/public',\ncontaining this simple CSS code.\n    #cksum_fancy {\n       border: 2px solid green;\n    }\n\nOther static assets\nTwo other files are created by the generator under 'views/public':\n\nedit_params_help.html is shown as a 'help' link above the task's\nparameter form. This is a pure static html excerpt. Simply document the\nparameters there.\n\ntool_info.html is shown in the \"Tools Index\" page, as a link called \"info\".\nEnter a general description of the tool on this page.\n\n\nWe do not edit these files in this tutorial.\nTrying the interface\nAt this point, we have all the code necessary to implement the\ntask's life cycle on the frontend.  In order to test it, though,\nwe have to configure it within CBRAIN.\nThe full documentation for creating tool versions is in Tools,\nbut for the moment we will only use the minimum code necessary to\ncreate versions \"1.0.0\" and \"2.0.0\" of the tool.\nCreating a Tool for CkSum\nA Tool represents an application in general, irrespective of where\nit is deployed and which versions exist.\n\nUsing the CBRAIN interface as an administrator, go to the \"Tools\" index page.\nClick \"Create new tool\"\nFill in the form; call the tool 'CkSum'; the field \"CbrainTask Class\" must be filled\nwith \"CbrainTask::MyCksum\", which is the name of the Ruby class in the code.\nThe other fields are not that important, except perhaps the field \"Text for select box on\nthe userfiles page\", which should contain a message such as \"Launch my CkSum\".\n\nCreating two ToolConfigs\nA tool config represents a particular installation of a tool. We\ncreate two versions.\n\nUsing the CBRAIN interface as an administrator, go to the \"Tools\" index page.\nThe 'CkSum' tool should be listed on that page - click on its name.\nThe page for the 'CkSum' tool is now displayed, with a list of execution servers at the bottom and\nthe message, \"No specific version configured\" for each one.\nClick the \"Add new\" link below the test execution server.\nAt this point there is a new form to fill; this is the description of one particular version\nof the 'CkSum' tool.\nEnter '1.0.0' in the 'Version' field.\nEnter a short description, leave the number of CPUs to '1',  and if desired, enter environment variables or\na bash prologue script (these are all optional).\nSave the config.\nRepeat for a second tool config with a version name called \"2.0.0\"; also make sure\nthat this version has its number of CPUs set to \"2\" instead of one (this is part of\nthe demonstration of automatic parallelism within CBRAIN).\n\nExamining the parameters form page\nNow, as any user, go to the File manager, select one or several\nfiles, then go the the \"Launch Task\" menu. The launch message should\nbe configured above for the tool (e.g. 'Launch my CkSum'). When\nprompted to choose a version, select version 1.0.0.\nAt that point you are sent to the task params page, and you can try\nrefreshing it with the refresh button, or entering invalid values\nfor the output name prefix. Click 'Start MyCkSum' at the very bottom,\nand the task object is saved in the database in state 'New'.\nTry with version \"2.0.0\", too, where the version-specific input\nfield should contain an odd number.\nEditing the Bourreau-side model\nThe Bourreau side is where the actual wrapping code for the tool\nresides. There is only one file to edit, fortunately:\n'bourreau/my_cksum.rb'. There are three methods to fill on the\nBourreau side:\n\nsetup()\ncluster_commands()\nsave_results()\n\nsetup()\nThis purpose of this method is to validate once more its parameters,\nsynchronize its input files, and otherwise prepare anything needed\nfor running the tool (like creating directories or creating symbolic links to the input files).\nThere are numerous helper methods available to automate many common\noperations, but few of them are used here. We simply make sure that\nthe parameter :an_odd_number is odd if we're running version \"2.0.0\"\nand synchronize the single input file (that is, make a copy in the\nBourreau local cache) and create a symbolic link to its data.\n    def setup\n      # on the portal side, we replace this array by another one containing a single ID\n      # in the method final_task_list()\n      id = params[:interface_userfile_ids][0]\n      # Sync file\n      file = SingleFile.find(id)\n      file.sync_to_cache\n      # Create symlink locally, with same base name\n      filename = file.name\n      cached_path = file.cache_full_path\n      safe_symlink(cached_path,filename) # does not mind if it already exists\n      if self.tool_config.is_at_least_version('2.0.0')\n        cb_error \"Oh no our number isn't odd!\" if (params[:an_odd_number].to_i % 2) != 1\n      end\n      true # must return true if all OK\n    end\n\ncluster_commands()\nThis is where we build a bash script to encapsulate the execution\nof the tool.  In the case of the 'cksum' program, we show how CBRAIN\ncaptures the output and error channels of the script by echoing\nsome words on these channels. Also the script runs 'cksum' on the\ninput file and sends its result to a local output file named\n'PREFIXmyout-tttt-rrrr.txt', where prefix is one of the parameters,\ntttt is the task's ID and rrrr is a run number, which starts at 1\nand increases by 1 whenever the task is restarted. None of the other\nparameters are used.\n    def cluster_commands\n      id      = params[:interface_userfile_ids][0]\n      file    = SingleFile.find(id)\n      runid   = self.run_id # utility method, returns \"#{task_id}-#{run_number}\"\n      prefix  = params[:output_file_prefix]\n      outname = \"#{prefix}myout-#{runid}.txt\"\n      [  # for historical reasons, this method should return an array of strings....\n        \"# bash script starts here\",\n        \"echo This is standard output\",\n        \"echo This is standard error 1>&2\",\n        \"echo This is the report from my task > #{outname}\",\n        \"cksum #{file.name} >> #{outname}\"\n      ]\n    end\n\nsave_results()\nThis method is invoked when the task has finished on the cluster\nside. Typically, the method should verify that the script has run\nproperly and if so then create new userfiles to store the outputs\nof the tool.\nHere we carry out the following steps:\n\nVerify that the output file from the bash script exists.\nSave its content in the database as a new TextFile.\nLog information about this processing to both the input file and the output file.\nStore the ID of the new output file in the params hash, as :report_id, so it\nshows up when looking at the web page information about the task.\n\n    def save_results\n      id      = params[:interface_userfile_ids][0]\n      infile  = SingleFile.find(id)\n      runid   = self.run_id # utility method, returns \"#{task_id}-#{run_number}\"\n      prefix  = params[:output_file_prefix]\n      outname = \"#{prefix}myout-#{runid}.txt\"\n      cb_error \"Can't find my output file '#{outname}' ?!?\" unless File.exists?(outname)\n      outfile = safe_userfile_find_or_new(TextFile,  # utility of ClusterTask\n                  { :name => outname,\n                    :data_provider_id => self.results_data_provider_id.presence || infile.data_provider_id\n                  }\n                )\n      outfile.cache_copy_from_local_file(outname) # also saves to official data provider\n      outfile.move_to_child_of(infile)\n      self.addlog_to_userfiles_these_created_these([infile],[outfile]) # utility of ClusterTask\n      self.params[:report_id] = outfile.id  # so that the show page for the task shows it\n      true\n    end\n\nTrying the whole process\nIf you edited 'bourreau/my_cksum.rb', then it is necessary to restart\nthe execution server for it to be able to load the new code, even\nin development mode. Make sure to run at least once the rake task\nthat installs the symlinks necessary for the plugin. Once that is\ndone, it is possible to launch the task again, as explained above.\nThis time, on the execution side, the bash script is run and the\noutput file should be added to the file manager. If something goes\nwrong, inspect the content of the task's work directory and look\nat all the logs provided by CBRAIN.\nMoving forward\nThere are many features of the CbrainTask framework that are not\ncovered in this tutorial:\n\nThere is a wide set of input fields helpers, described in the class CbrainTaskFormBuilder.\nTasks can be made to depend on other tasks, as explained in CbrainTask Prerequisites.\nTasks can be configured to share work directories (by default, each task is launched in a\nprivate work directory), as explained in CbrainTask SharedWorkDir.\nTasks can be parallelized automatically, as explained in CbrainTask Parallelization.\nSuccessful tasks can be configured to be restarted at different points in their life\ncycle, using special callbacks to prepare them for such events, as explained\nin CbrainTask Recovery And Restart.\nFailed tasks can be written to allow better error recovery (including callback to\nperform cleanup), also explained in CbrainTask Recovery And Restart.\n\nNote: Original author of this document is Pierre Rioux\n\nif ('UA-XXXXXXXXX-X') {\n\t(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n\t(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n\tm=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n\t})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n\tga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');\n\tga('send', 'pageview');\n}\n\n"},"3-programmer/cbrain-task/Rails-CbrainTask-Generator.html":{"url":"3-programmer/cbrain-task/Rails-CbrainTask-Generator.html","title":"Rails CbrainTask Generator","keywords":"","body":"CBRAIN comes with a Rails generator to help programmers create new\nCbrainTasks.

To solve this problem a task programmer can \nexplicitly program a CbrainTask such that the bash script calls several copies \nof the scientific task. This is however error prone, as it complicates the \ndata synchronization steps, run-time monitoring and error recovery code. \nThe CBRAIN task framework has the ability to transparently remedy this situation, \nwithout having to recode existing tasks.\nAutomatic parallelization\nBasically, when a task is about to be launched,\nthe Rails tasks controller will check to see if the following three\nconditions are true:\n\nThe task's class properties() contain the keyword\n:use_parallelizer; it needs to be set to true or a number (which\nwill be explained later).\n\nAn array of task objects is about to be launched (that is, the\nfinal_task_list() returned more than one element). This is\nobviously necessary, since we are trying to parallelize them.\n\nThe ToolConfig chosen by the user for the task has a suggested\nnumber of CPUs (ncpus) greater than 1.\n\n\nIf all three conditions are true, then the task launching mechanism will\nbe altered in the following way:\n\nThe tasks will be created exactly as usual, except their\nstarting state will be Standby instead of New. Tasks in this\nstate are ignored by all other system components, including\nBourreaux and their Workers.\n\nOne (or several) additional Parallelizer tasks will be\nautomatically created and launched. Each of these Parallelizer\ntasks will be responsible for a subset of the original tasks\n(henceforth called 'parallelized') that were created in\nStandby. The size of the subsets will be the minimum between\nthe parallelized task's tool config's ncpus and the numeric\nvalue given to :use_parallelizer (if any).  The Parallelizer\ntask will then 'turn on' the other parallelized tasks. 'Turning\non', here, consists in:\n\nSetting a special meta attribute on the tasks called\n:configure_only.  This will be used by the Bourreau Workers\nduring Setting Up, at a later time.\n\nSetting their status to New, which sends them on the\nstandard task state diagram path.\n\n\n\n\nThe Parallelizer tasks are configured with a prerequisites: all the\nparallelized tasks that they are responsible for must be in a special\nstate called Configured. Here's how this will happen:\n\nEach parallelized task, after having been 'turned on' as\nexplained above, will be recognized by the Bourreau Workers and\nwill proceed through their Setting Up process.\n\nAt the very end of being set up, after the bash script is\nwritten on disk, the tasks will detect that the meta property\n:configure_only is set. In that case, they will NOT submit\ntheir bash scripts to the cluster but instead will change\ntheir status to Configured.\n\n\nOnce all parallelized tasks are in state Configured, the Parallelizer\ntasks will be triggered. Once they are running on the cluster nodes,\nthey will go into the parallelized tasks' work directories and run\nthe bash scripts in parallel on behalf of those other tasks.\nOnce a Parallelizer task's cluster job is finished, it will mark\nall its parallelized tasks as Data Ready so that they can proceed\nwith their normal Post Processing steps.\nHow to trigger parallelization of existing CbrainTasks\nAs described above, the new parallelization framework is built on\ntop of the standard serial design philosophy of the CbrainTasks.\nIt should work automatically for all standard CbrainTasks (except\nfor the most esoteric, like those that save their objects in\nfinal_task_list()) but for the moment we require task programmers\nto enable automatic parallel support by adding the keyword\n:use_parallelizer in their PortalTask's class definition.\nA programmer aware of the memory or CPU requirements of his scientific\nsoftware can provide a maximum number of parallel execution as a\nvalue, or instead just provide true and let the ToolConfigs\nactually specify the number of task instances per Parallelizer.\nCBRAIN administrator configuration\nFor parallelization to work with existing tasks, the sysadmin must\nconfigure a few more values using the CBRAIN interface.\n\nThe tool \"Parallelizer\" must first be configured using the\nCreate Tool button of the Tools panel. The name can be something\nelse than Parallelizer, but the class must be exactly\nCbrainTask::Parallelizer. To make the tool invisible to\nusers in the task launcher selection box, set the tool's\nCategory to \"background\". The descriptions and launch messages\nmust also be filled but will be ignored.\n\nEach of the CbrainTasks that needs to be parallelized also\nneeds to have at least one ToolConfig, with a suggested number\nof CPUs greater than one. We recommend indicating clearly in the\ntool config's description that the tool will be run in\nparallel mode.\n\n\nState diagram\nThis diagram is a variation of the standard state diagram\nfor CbrainTasks, as seen in the CbrainTask Programmer Guide.\nIt shows how a task that has been parallelized by an external\nparalellizer will proceed through a different set of status\ncodes. The Parallelizer itself will follow the standard path.\n\nNote: Original author of this document is Pierre Rioux\n\nif ('UA-XXXXXXXXX-X') {\n\t(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n\t(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n\tm=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n\t})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n\tga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');\n\tga('send', 'pageview');\n}\n\n"},"3-programmer/cbrain-task/CbrainTask-Recovery-and-Restart.html":{"url":"3-programmer/cbrain-task/CbrainTask-Recovery-and-Restart.html","title":"Recovery And Restart","keywords":"","body":"Failures of the scientific tasks on the CBRAIN clusters are a fact\nof life.

Here is the list,\nwith a short explanation about what triggers these errors:\n\n\n\nStatus\nComment\n\n\n\n\nFailed To Setup\nException or false in setup()\n\n\nFailed On Cluster\nsave_results() returned false\n\n\nFailed To Post Process\nException in save_results()\n\n\nFailed Setup Prerequisites\nOther tasks misbehaved\n\n\nFailed PostProcess Prerequisites\nOther tasks misbehaved\n\n\n\nTwo of these can be eliminated right away from the rest of the\ndiscussion: the Failed * Prerequisites situations can be recovered\nfrom simply by resetting the state of the task object to an earlier\nstate, and prerequisites evaluation will be retried the next time\na BourreauWorker wakes up. So for these two error situations, all\ntasks already have the ability to recover from the failure (although\nit's possible the task will fail its prerequisites check again).\nThe other three error states correspond to the three main stages\nresponsible for processing a task. As explained in the\nCbrainTask Programmer Guide, a task will have:\n\nA pure Ruby stage called Setting Up.\nIt's implemented by the method setup() in the CbrainTask's\nRuby code. Its purpose is to create subdirectories, files and\nsynchronize data files before the real CPU-intensive processing\noccurs on the cluster.\n\nA bash script run on the cluster during On CPU.\nIt's provided by the method cluster_commands(). The bash\nscript is usually a set of calls to the scientific program that\nwill perform the task's main computation.\n\nAnother pure Ruby stage called Post Processing.\nIt's implemented by the method save_results() in the CbrainTask's\nRuby code. Its purpose is first to make sure the bash commands\nfinished properly and if so to package and return the resulting\ndata files and reports to the CBRAIN environment.\n\n\nSo how are the error states triggered? In the case of the two Ruby\nstages, any exception raised by the CbrainTask's code will stop the\ntask and mark it as Failed To Setup or Failed To Post Process.\nAdditionally, if the setup() method returns false, the task will\nalso be marked as Failed To Setup.\nHowever, the post processing stage implemented in save_results()\nwill trigger a different error if it returns false: it will mark\nthe task as Failed On Cluster. This is the conventional mechanism\nused by a developer to detect if the bash script that was run on\nthe cluster finished successfully. Return false if the bash commands\ndid not perform their job adequately and the task will properly\nrecord that the error really occurred during the cluster's bash\nscript execution, not during post processing.\nError recovery\nIt's left to the user to look at the logs of a failed CbrainTask\nto figure out if the error situation is recoverable or not. There\nisn't much one can do about errors that are caused by bugs in the\nCbrainTask's setup() or save_results() methods (except maybe\nnotify the developer).  But other error situations are usually\neasily recoverable. For instance, if a file synchronization failed\nbecause the remote DataProvider is offline, we expect we should be\nable to turn it back on and try again the task where it failed.\nExcept for the two errors related to Prerequisites (described above\nin section 1), no CbrainTask is recoverable by default. To make a\ntask recoverable, one needs to enable the capability by providing\na recovery method which must return true. There is a specific method\nto define for each of the three error states:\n\n\n\nError State\nCbrainTask's Recovery Method Name\n\n\n\n\nFailed To Setup\nrecover_from_setup_failure()\n\n\nFailed On Cluster\nrecover_from_cluster_failure()\n\n\nFailed Post Processing\nrecover_from_post_processing_failure()\n\n\n\nJust like for the setup() and save_results() methods, the developer\ncan count on the fact that when these recovery methods are invoked,\nthe current directory of the process will already have been changed\nto the task's work directory.\nThe methods are expected to return true if they think they've\nproperly fixed the task's environment so that it can restart. While\nthe method runs, the task's status will be changed to one of these\nkeywords:\n\n\n\nOriginal Error State\nState While Executing Recovery Method\n\n\n\n\nFailed To Setup\nRecovering Setup\n\n\nFailed On Cluster\nRecovering Cluster\n\n\nFailed Post Processing\nRecovering PostProcess\n\n\n\nIf the method returns false or raise an exception, the task's status\nwill return to the original error state and nothing else will happen.\nIf the method returns true, the task's status will be set to one of\nthe states in the normal processing path:\n\n\n\nOriginal Error State\nNormal CbrainTask State After Recovery\n\n\n\n\nFailed To Setup\nNew\n\n\nFailed On Cluster\nQueued (new cluster job launched)\n\n\nFailed Post Processing\nData Ready\n\n\n\nThe developer doesn't have to touch the task's status, this tracking\nis all performed by the CbrainTask base class.\nTask restart\nThis section describe a concept strongly related to error recovery.\nIn the situation where a CbrainTask completed successfully (it went\nall the way to state Completed), it's possible to imagine that\none would like to redo some parts of the processing. This mechanism\nis called 'restarting', and can occur at exactly the same three\nstages as error recovery (described in the previous section):\n\nAt setup: Basically, the entire task is restarted. The task's\nwork directory is left 'as is', and the setup() method is called\nnormally. If everything goes well, a new job will be launched\non the cluster and post processing will eventually take place.\n\nAt cluster: We skip setup and relaunch the task's job on\nthe cluster.\n\nAt post processing: we only re-run the post processing\ncode in save_results().\n\n\nJust like in error recovery, a CbrainTask needs to have special\nmethods implemented in order to enable the three restart capabilities.\nThe three methods are:\n\n\n\nRestart stage *\nCbrainTask's Restart Method Name\n\n\n\n\nAt setup\nrestart_at_setup()\n\n\nAt cluster\nrestart_at_cluster()\n\n\nAt post processing\nrestart_at_post_processing()\n\n\n\n  * These are not status keywords\nThe methods are expected to prepare the task's existing (and\npopulated) work directory for a restart. This can include erasing\nsome files, creating new ones, adjusting parameter values, etc.\nWhile the method is running, the task's state will be set\nto one of these keywords:\n\n\n\nRestart Method Name\nState While Executing Restart Method\n\n\n\n\nrestart_at_setup()\nRestarting Setup\n\n\nrestart_at_cluster()\nRestarting Cluster\n\n\nrestart_at_post_processing()\nRestarting PostProcess\n\n\n\nJust like in error recovery, the methods must return true for the\nrestart capability to be enabled. Returning false will cancel the\nrestart and the task's status will stay in Completed. If\na restart method is successful, the task's state will return\nto one of three values:\n\n\n\nRestart stage *\nCbrainTask's State After Restart\n\n\n\n\nAt setup\nNew\n\n\nAt cluster\nQueued (new cluster job launched)\n\n\nAt post processing\nData Ready\n\n\n\n  * These are not status keywords\nUnlike error recovery, the CBRAIN system's task management will\nprovide a way for tracking separately the task's standard output,\nstandard error and anything else that the developer wants to track\nseparately for each restart session. This is accomplished by having\na new attribute called :run_number in the task. This is originally\ninitialized at '1' and is used to build the filenames of the files\nthat captures the outputs and errors for the task. The :run_number\nattribute is not affected by error recovery or task failures, but\nit is increased by one after each successful invocation of the\nrestart_*() methods listed above.\nA developer can use the :run_number to build filenames for work\nfiles or Userfiles too. Some other useful methods build strings\nthat can be used for tracking the run number, see the documentation\nfor the method run_id() for instance.\nWriting Code That Is Naturally Restartable\nBoth the error recovery capabilities and the restart capabilities\ncan be made simpler for the average CbrainTask programmer by following\na few simple rules while writing the Ruby code in setup() and\nsave_results(). The most obvious cases are encountered when trying\nto configure a resource that already exists; for instance, the\nsetup() method could want to create a work subdirectory named\nmy_output and the developer would normally write this:\nDir.mkdir(\"my_output\")   # OK, but not restartable\n\nIf the job is restarted or if we are attempting error recovery,\nthis statement will raise an exception because the subdirectory\nalready exists. A better way to proceed is to make a simple check:\nDir.mkdir(\"my_output\") unless File.directory?(\"my_output\")\n\nAs another example, consider the case where in the save_results()\nmethod a programmer creates a new userfile to store results:\nres = SingleFile.create!( # works only once!\n           :name             => \"results-#{self.run_id}\",\n           :data_provider_id => dpid,\n           :user_id          => user.id,\n           :group_id         => user.own_group.id\n         )\nres.cache_copy_from_local_file(\"my_output/report.txt\")\n\nImagine that the data provider is offline; then the database entry\nfor the SingleFile 'res' will be properly created but the\ncache_copy_from_local_file() will crash. This code is not recoverable\nbecause on a second pass through it, it will attempt to recreate\nthe SingleFile, raising a new exception in method create!() (because\nonly one file can have the same name on the same data provider, per\nuser). A way to make the code recover is to delete the SingleFile\nin the recovery method:\ndef recover_from_post_processing_failure\n  bad_res = SingleFile.find(:first, :conditions =>\n                          { :name => \"results-#{self.run_id}\" } )\n  bad_res.destroy if bad_res\n  true\nend\n\nA much better way to write the save_result() code is to make the\nresult file creation code fully restartable (and recoverable):\nres_att = {\n  :name             => \"results-#{self.run_id}\",\n  :data_provider_id => dpid,\n  :user_id          => user.id,\n  :group_id         => user.own_group.id\n }\nres = SingleFile.find(:first, :conditions => res_att) ||\n      SingleFile.create!(res_att) # works multiple times!\nres.cache_copy_from_local_file(\"my_output/report.txt\")\n\nThis way, you can attempt to execute the same piece of code several\ntimes and the SingleFile creation code will either create the file\nor fetch the previously created one. The big advantage of writing\ncode that is naturally restartable is that the recover_*() and\nrestart_*() methods become naturally trivial too: you can make them\nsimply return true:\ndef recover_from_post_processing_failure\n  true # so simple now!\nend\n\nIn order to simply writing CbrainTask code that is restartable, a few\nutility instance methods have been added to the CbrainTask class:\n  safe_mkdir(\"relative_path_to_some_work_subdir\",mode)\n  safe_symlink(\"path_to_something\",\"rel_path_to_new_symlink\")\n  safe_userfile_find_or_new(klass, attlist)\n\nSee the documentation in the class CbrainTask for more information.\nBrainPortal interface / Bourreau controller\nThe BrainPortal interface has been enhanced to provide a way to\nrestart tasks, or attempt error recovery. Basically, the interface\ndoes NOT know which tasks are restartable or recoverable, it just\nsends the request to the Bourreau side. If the restart or recovery\ncapabilities are programmed for a task, they will be triggered,\notherwise the tasks are left alone. The task's log will track the\nattempts made for restarting or recovery.\nThe interface also provides a way to trigger recovery for tasks\nwith failed prerequisites, or to duplicate an existing task completely\n(this means restarting it anew with a new work directory, so this\nis not a 'restart' like described above).\nOn the Bourreau side, the requests are received and the tasks\naffected will get a new status. Again, the Bourreau does not know\nwhich task is restartable or recoverable, it only validates that\nthe task's CURRENT state is compatible with the restart or recover\nrequest. Here are the five status keywords that the Bourreau\nintercepts and validates, and the status that gets saved to the\ntasks to trigger the error recovery or restart code:\n\n\n\nBourreau ReceivesThis Keyword\nAllowed TaskCurrent Status\nTask ActionStatus\n\n\n\n\nRecover\nFailed * Prerequisites\n\"New\" or \"Data Ready\"\n\n\nRecover\nFailed To Setup\nRecover Setup\n\n\nRecover\nFailed On Cluster\nRecover Cluster\n\n\nRecover\nFailed To Post Process\nRecover PostProcess\n\n\nRestart Setup\nCompleted\nRestart Setup\n\n\nRestart Cluster\nCompleted\nRestart Cluster\n\n\nRestart PostProcess\nCompleted\nRestart PostProcess\n\n\n\nThe 'Action Status' are recognized by the Bourreau Workers, which\nthen trigger the recovery or restart methods and track whether or\nnot they are successful. As explained in the previous section, these\nstatuses will be changed to ones with '-ing' in their names, such\nas Recovering Setup, while the methods are running.\nState diagrams\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Original author of this document is Pierre Rioux\n\nif ('UA-XXXXXXXXX-X') {\n\t(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n\t(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n\tm=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n\t})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n\tga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');\n\tga('send', 'pageview');\n}\n\n"},"3-programmer/cbrain-task/CbrainTask-Prerequisites.html":{"url":"3-programmer/cbrain-task/CbrainTask-Prerequisites.html","title":"Task Dependencies","keywords":"","body":"Prerequisites are properties of CBRAIN CbrainTask objects that allow\nprogrammers to specify dependencies between tasks. It makes it\npossible to specify that a task's life cycle depends on other\ntasks' life cycles. This document explains how this mechanism is\nimplemented and how to use it. Developers need to first understand the\noverall state diagram of a CbrainTask in order to fully follow this\ndiscussion; please refer to the CbrainTask Programmer Guide\nfor more information about this.\nLife cycle prerequisites\nThe CBRAIN task objects have an attribute called 'prerequisites'. It is\nstructured as a hash table, although it is not important for developers to\nunderstand this in detail since there is an API to populate it properly.\nBasically, it makes it possible to configure a task such that its progress on\nthe cluster will depend on the progress of one or several other tasks.\nTo understand the possibilities offered by this feature, it is necessary\nto review the life cycle of a task. There are many different states that a\ntask can go through, but for most purposes, we only need to describe\nTHREE essential ones:\n  Setting up -> On CPU -> Post processing\n\nSetting up\n\nLanguage: Ruby\nCode: Method setup() in the Bourreau's CbrainTask\nPerformed by: BourreauWorker\nEffect: Creating the work directory and running the setup code\nState reached upon completion: \"Queued\"\n\n\nOn CPU\n\nLanguage: bash commands, to run scientific programs\nCode: Supplied by the cluster_commands() method in the CbrainTask\nPerformed by: Cluster's computing nodes\nEffect: Scientific processing\nState reached upon completion: \"Data ready\"\n\n\nPost processing\n\nLanguage: Ruby\nCode: Method save_results() in the Bourreau's CbrainTask\nPerformed by: BourreauWorker\nEffect: Saving the results back in the CBRAIN Data Providers\nState reached upon completion: \"Completed\"\n\n\n\nNote that each of these three stages has an associated state that\nindicates when the stage is finished. For instance, the Setting up\nstate is finished once the Queued state has started. Similarly, the\nPost processing state is finished once the Completed state\nhas started. This is important because the prerequisite system uses\nthese associated state names.\nNow, assume there is an existing task E on the cluster and a\nnew task N is created. Restrictions on the progress of task N can\nbe imposed at two places in its life cycle:\n\nTask N can be blocked before it enters the Setting up state (i.e. it will\nstay in the New state).\nTask N can be blocked before it enters the Post processing state (i.e. it\nwill stay in the Data ready state).\n\nThe blocking can occur based on the three completion statuses\ndiscussed above:\n\nUntil task E is in the Queued state (or later)\nUntil task E is in the Data ready state (or later)\nUntil task E is in the Completed state\n\nplus one more special condition:\n\nUntil task E is in Failed state (any of the failed states).\n\nNote that the blocking of task N can happen both before the Setting up\nstate and Post processing state and in each case there can be multiple\nother tasks involved, each specified with one of their three\ncompletion statuses (or a Failed state).\nAPI methods\nThe prerequisites API works to allow you to set up these rules easily.\nThere are only two methods, based on the two blocking states for\nyour task:\n\nadd_prerequisites_for_setup(other_task,other_state = 'Completed')\nadd_prerequisites_for_post_processing(other_task,other_state = 'Completed')\n\nExample\nHere is a complete example that you can run on the console.\ndp_id = DataProvider.first.id # adjust\ntc    = ToolConfig.first      # adjust\nbo_id = tc.bourreau_id\nus_id = User.first.id         # adjust\n\n# Create a new task t1; it lasts three minutes, 60 seconds in each stage\nt1        = CbrainTask::Diagnostics.new(\n              :user_id        => us_id,\n              :bourreau_id    => bo_id,\n              :tool_config_id => tc.id,\n              :status         => 'New'\n            )\nt1.params = {\n   :setup_delay => 60,\n   :cluster_delay => 60,\n   :postpro_delay => 60\n}\nt1.save # launch it\n\n# Create a new task t2 that depends on the other one, t1:\nt2        = t1.dup ; t2.status = 'New' # just to be sure\nt2.params = {} # nothing special\n# Let's make it so t2 can only be in setup once t1 is on CPU.\nt2.add_prerequisites_for_setup(t1,'Queued')\nt2.save\n\n# Let's make t3 run right away but be blocked at its post\n# processing until t1 has finished on CPU and t2 is fully finished.\nt3        = t1.dup ; t3.status = 'New'\nt3.params = {} # nothing special\nt3.add_prerequisites_for_post_processing(t1,\"Data Ready\")\nt3.add_prerequisites_for_post_processing(t2,\"Completed\")\nt3.save\n\nThus there is an artificial delay at task t1, but all the other tasks execute\nas fast as possible. A typical run of these three tasks, if they are all submitted\nat once, would result in the following sequence of events:\n\nAt 0 seconds:\nt1 -> Setting up [60 seconds long]\nt2 -> New [blocked for t1]\nt3 -> Setting up -> Queued -> On CPU -> Data ready [blocked for t1 and t2] (quickly)\n\n\nAt 60 seconds:\nt1 -> Queued -> On CPU [60 seconds long]\nt2 -> Setting up -> Queued -> On CPU -> Data ready -> Post processing -> Completed\nt3 -> [still blocked for t1]\n\n\nAt 120 seconds:\nt1 -> Data ready -> Post processing [60 seconds long]\nt3 -> Post processing -> Completed\n\n\nAt 180 seconds:\nt1 -> Completed\n\n\n\nThis system is general enough that most processing dataflows can\nbe implemented using it. It also has some nice features that arise since\ntask statuses are retrieved from a central database: a task can depend\non the state of tasks running on OTHER clusters!\nNote: Original author of this document is Pierre Rioux.\n\nif ('UA-XXXXXXXXX-X') {\n\t(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n\t(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n\tm=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n\t})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n\tga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');\n\tga('send', 'pageview');\n}\n\n"},"3-programmer/cbrain-task/CbrainTask-SharedWorkDir.html":{"url":"3-programmer/cbrain-task/CbrainTask-SharedWorkDir.html","title":"Sharing A Work Directory","keywords":"","body":"A developer creating a new CbrainTask can specify that it should reuse \nthe work directory of another previously existing task. This could be useful \nif a scientific job is launched on a cluster and a follow-up 'cleanup' or \n'reporting' job needs to use the same temporary files and directories.\nAPI methods\nWhen a new task, 'mytask', is created, its work directory can be set to be that\nof an existing task, 'othertask'.  This can be done simply by setting the attribute\n:share_wd_tid in the new 'mytask' object to the ID of 'othertask':\n  mytask.share_wd_tid = othertask.id\n\nA method can be used to set the attribute while at the same time\nsetting a prerequisite rule:\n   mytask.share_workdir_with(othertask)\n\nSetting the prerequisite is the equivalent of calling:\n   mytask.add_prerequisites_for_setup(othertask,\"Completed\")\n\nFor more information about prerequisites, see the following document:\nCbrainTask Prerequisites.\nExample\nThe following code can be run on the console:\n  othertask           = CbrainTask::Diagnostics.new(\n                          :user_id        => 1,\n                          :tool_config_id => 1,\n                          :status         => 'New',\n                          :params         => {},\n                        ) # adjust the IDs\n  othertask.save\n\n  mytask              = othertask.dup; mytask.status = 'New'\n  mytask.share_wd_tid = othertask.id                       # Use othertask's work directory!\n  mytask.add_prerequisite_for_setup(othertask,\"Queued\") # to prevent race conditions\n  mytask.save\n\nBoth tasks have the same path name in their attribute :cluster_workdir, \nonce they have been set up. Also, their standard outputs and\nerrors are stored in distinct files and are not mixed up, which can be\nconfirmed by examining the contents of the workdir with \"ls -a\".\nAs explained in the API section above, the assignment to share_wd_tid\nand the prerequisites can be set in a single step by this utility method:\n  mytask.share_workdir_with(othertask,\"Queued\")\n\nCaveats to this approach\nThere are some obvious caveats to this method:\n\nThe 'othertask' must be on the same Bourreau.\n\nThe 'othertask' must have an ID assigned (e.g. that assigned after save()).\n\nThe 'othertask' must still have its work directory stored on\nthe cluster. Tasks that are removed using the 'Remove selected task' \nbutton on the interface have their work directories erased.\nAlso, some cluster operators may delete the scratch disk\nspace used by the task if it has been there for too long.\nIf the work directory has disappeared, the 'mytask' task will not\nset up and it will fail with \"Failed To setup\".\n\n\nArbitrary sharing in final_task_list()\nProgrammers who are planning to create arrays\nof tasks using the portal-side framework can\ntell the framework to automatically share the\nwork directories of arbitrary subsets of tasks\nof the array. This is performed by assigning\nnegative values to the share_wd_tid attributes\nof the tasks that are returned by final_task_list().\nThe rules are simple:\n\nAll tasks with the same negative value will share the work \ndirectories of the first task with that value.\n\nAs usual, tasks with nil values will get their own private work \ndirectories.\n\nTasks with positive values will use the work directory of the task \nwith that value's ID, as described above.\n\n\nHere's an example. The final_task_list() method shown here will \nreturn five tasks, partitioned such that three work directories are used:\n  # Create five clones of the current task, each with a different description.\n  # Task 0 and 3 share 0's workdir, task 1 and 4 share 1's workdir\n  # and task 2 has its own private workdir.\n  def final_task_list\n    share_values = [ -100, -44, nil, -100, -44 ] # five aribitrary share_wd_tid values\n    taskarray = 5.times.map do |i|\n      cloned_t = self.clone\n      cloned_t.description = \"Task #{i}\"\n      cloned_t.share_wd_tid = share_values[i] # gets nil, or -100, or -44\n      cloned_t\n    end\n    return taskarray # [ t1 -> -100, t2 -> -44, t3 -> nil, t4 -> -100, t5 -> -44 ]\n end\n\nNote: Original author of this document is Pierre Rioux\n\nif ('UA-XXXXXXXXX-X') {\n\t(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n\t(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n\tm=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n\t})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n\tga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');\n\tga('send', 'pageview');\n}\n\n"},"3-programmer/cbrain-task/Task-Helpers.html":{"url":"3-programmer/cbrain-task/Task-Helpers.html","title":"Task Helpers","keywords":"","body":"This document contains several lists of helper methods\nfor writing CBRAIN tasks, with some notes.\nFull descriptions of the methods with examples can be\nobtained by generating the code documentation, as explained\nat the begining of the Programmer Guides.\nMethods listed in the following tables use this convention:\n\nClass method names are preceded by ::\nInstance method names are preceded by #\n\nCbrainTask Model Helpers\nThese methods are usually defined in the file models/cbrain_task.rb\nand are thus available on both the Portal and Bourreau side of a CBRAIN\ninstallation.\nMethods returning IDs, names, and combined identifiers\n\n\n\nMethod Name\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n::pretty_type\n\n\n\n#name\n\n\n\n#name_and_bourreau\n\n\n\n#fullname\n\n\n\n#pretty_name\n\n\n\n::pretty_name\n\n\n\n#bid_tid\n\n\n\n#bname_tid\n\n\n\n#bname_tid_dashed\n\n\n\n#tname_tid\n\n\n\n#run_number\n\n\n\n#run_id\n\n\n\nMethods returning properties of a task\n\n\n\nMethod Name\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n::tool\nNot an attribute of a CbrainTask.\n\n\n#tool\n\n\n\n#full_cluster_workdir\n\n\n\n#cluster_shared_dir\n\n\n\n#short_description\n\n\n\n#archived_status\n\n\n\nMethods related to creating dependencies with other tasks\n\n\n\nMethod Name\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n#share_workdir_with\n\n\n\n#add_prerequisites\n\n\n\n#remove_prerequisites\n\n\n\n#add_prerequisites_for_setup\n\n\n\n#add_prerequisites_for_post_processing\n\n\n\n#remove_prerequisites_for_setup\n\n\n\n#remove_prerequisites_for_post_processing\n\n\n\nAdditional data provenance methods\n\n\n\nMethod Name\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n#addlog\n\n\n\n#addlog_exception\n\n\n\n#addlog_current_resource_revision\n\n\n\nCallbacks and other custom controls\n\n\n\nMethod Name\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n::after_status_transition\nCan be used as a directive in a class\n\n\n\nPortalTask Model Helpers\nThese methods are only available when tasks are instanciated on a\nBrainPortal rails application.

Then, the approach\nto writing new tests when bugs that have been uncovered pop up will be discussed.  Finally, the document describes the approach to be taken to integrate test-writing into the development of new code. This document assumes the reader has an understanding of basic RSpec constructs, described in RSpec Basics\nWriting specs for existing code\nAs an example for the following, we will write the beginning of a spec for the DataProvider model. The first step when writing specs for existing code is to compartmentalize the tests we will be writing. We will first write an outer describe block for the model itself, and a nested describe block for each of the public methods. We will choose an incomplete set of methods to start with (although it would be a good idea to do all of them for a real case), so our spec will start out like this:\n  describe DataProvider do\n    describe \"#is_alive?\" do\n    end\n    describe \"#cache_prepare\" do\n    end\n  end\n\nThe next step is to go through and write the examples. If the method it\nis called without a block, the example will be considered pending. Thus it is\na good idea to write all the examples out without blocks at the beginning,\nand RSpec will keep track of the ones we have not implemented yet. First,\nstart with the #is_alive? method. Since #is_alive? has return values\nit is simpler to test. Essentially, we write an example (an it) for each\nlogical path. This should look something like this:\n  describe DataProvider do\n    describe \"#is_alive?\" do\n      it \"should return false when is_alive? is called on offline provider\"\n      it \"should raise and exception when is_alive! is called with an offline provider\"\n      it \"should raise an exception if called but not implemented in a subclass\"\n      it \"should return false if impl_is_alive? returns false\"\n    end\n    describe \"#cache_prepare\" do\n    end\n  end\n\nThe first three are fairly straightforward. We need a data_provider instance to\nplay with, so we will create one using a let statement.  Of course, we could also create an\ninstance variable in a before(:each) block, but generally \"let\"s are preferred, since they only instantiate the object once it is used.  Once we have a data provider to use, the first three examples\nare fairly straightforward to write.\n  describe DataProvider do\n    let(:provider) { create(:data_provider) }\n\n    describe \"#is_alive?\" do\n      it \"should return false when is_alive? is called on offline provider\" do\n        provider.online = false\n        expect(provider.is_alive?).to be_falsey\n      end\n\n     it \"should raise an exception if called but not implemented in a subclass\" do\n       expect(lambda{provider.is_alive?}).to raise_error(\"Error: method not yet implemented in subclass.\")\n     end\n\n     it \"should raise and exception when is_alive! is called with an offline provider\" do\n       provider.online = false\n       expect(lambda{ provider.is_alive! }).to raise_error(CbrainError, \"Error: provider #{provider.name} is offline.\")\n     end\n      it \"should return false if impl_is_alive? returns false\"\n    end\n    describe \"#cache_prepare\" do\n    end\n  end\n\nNow, the final example is more difficult to write. It is necessary to test using\nthe return value of a method that is not defined in this class. Several approaches could be\nused to solve the problem.  For example, it would be possible to define the method, or\ntest a subclass of DataProvider. Neither of these solutions is satisfying, since they would involve\neffectively testing things outside the scope of the spec. The best method is to use stubbing. Stubbing essentially makes it possible to hijack a method call on any object and fix its return value. The assumption is that the other method is working properly so that it is possible to test how the method we are currently working on reacts to it. Using this method, we have the following:\n  describe DataProvider do\n    let(:provider) { create(:data_provider) }\n\n    describe \"#is_alive?\" do\n      it \"should return false when is_alive? is called on offline provider\" do\n        provider.online = false\n        expect(provider.is_alive?).to be_falsey\n      end\n\n     it \"should raise an exception if called but not implemented in a subclass\" do\n       expect(lambda{ provider.is_alive? }).to raise_error(\"Error: method not yet implemented in subclass.\")\n     end\n\n     it \"should raise and exception when is_alive! is called with an offline provider\" do\n       provider.online = false\n       expect(lambda{ provider.is_alive! }).to raise_error\n     end\n      it \"should return false if impl_is_alive? returns false\" do\n        allow(provider).to receive(:impl_is_alive?).and_return(false)\n        provider.online = true\n        expect(provider.is_alive?).to be_falsey\n      end\n    end\n    describe \"#cache_prepare\" do\n    end\n  end\n\nMoving on to the #cache_prepare method, we encounter several new problems:\n\nDependency on another model (Userfile)\nInteractions with external factors (file system)\nComplex logic, with different prerequisites for different paths.\nNo testable return values.\n\nThe first problem is the dependency on another model. We could, of course,\nuse a factory to create a full Userfile to use with the method. But here it\ndoes not seem desirable to use a full Userfile object. Aside from the\noverhead of instantiating the full object, there is also the concern that\ninteraction with the Userfile object may have undesirable side effects (e.g.\ninteraction with the file system). In this case, we can take advantage\nof RSpec's mocking framework, to create a dummy object that simply has\na few stubbed methods that we need:\n  describe DataProvider do\n    let(:provider) { create(:data_provider) }\n    let(:userfile) { double(\"userfile\", :name => \"userfile_double\", :id => 123) }\n\n    describe \"#is_alive?\" do\n      ....\n    end\n    describe \"#cache_prepare\" do\n    end\n  end\n\nA mock is a dummy object. By default, it will not respond to any methods. If\nwe need certain methods to be defined, we can stub them (which is done here\nwith the hash argument to the double method). Finally, if we simply want\nour mock to respond to any methods called on it without doing anything,\nwe can call #is_null_object on it (it will return nil for any methods called\nthat are not stubbed to do otherwise).\nNote also that rspec-mocks provides some special mocking methods for mocking\nActiveRecord objects.\n\nmock_model: create a mock with some basic ActiveRecord methods stubbed out\n(e.g. id, valid?, new_record?, etc.). Optionally takes a single argument to describe\nwhich model is being mocked (for error messages, etc.)\nstub_model(class): this method will actually create object of the ActiveRecord\nsubclass given, but with methods stubbed out so as not to interact with the db.\n\nFor our purposes, we will use mock_model avoid having to define an id:\n  describe DataProvider do\n    let(:provider) { create(:data_provider) }\n    let(:userfile) { mock_model(Userfile, :name => \"userfile_double\") }\n\n    describe \"#is_alive?\" do\n      ....\n    end\n    describe \"#cache_prepare\" do\n    end\n  end\n\nNow comes the question of choosing the examples. There are two factors to consider\nhere. The first is that generally, when we write tests, we want to be testing the\nAPI, and not the implementation.  It is not really important how a method is doing what it is\ndoing (e.g. using an array vs. a hash table), as long as it works. On the other hand,\nsince #cache_prepare whose effect is not seen through the API, but through its effect on\nthe file system, we have to find some way to test that it is doing what it is supposed to be doing.\nThere may be several ways to do this. Here we have chosen to define some high-level actions that\nthe method is expected to perform. The method should check that the data provider is in a valid state,\nshould check that the cache is ready to be modified, should locate the cache's base directory, and\nfinally, it should attempt to  create a subdirectory to store the file if and only if it does not\nyet exist. Later, these actions will be mapped to internal method calls. This will render the tests\nsomewhat brittle, since changes to the implementation of the method, even if they do not affect\nbehavior, could cause the test to fail. It is for this reason that testing internal implementation\nshould be approached with care.\n  describe DataProvider do\n    let(:provider) { create(:data_provider) }\n    let(:userfile) { mock_model(Userfile, :name => \"userfile_double\") }\n\n    describe \"#is_alive?\" do\n      ....\n    end\n    describe \"#cache_prepare\" do\n      it \"should raise an exception if not online\"\n      it \"should raise an exception if read only\"\n      it \"should ensure that the cache is ready to be modified\"\n      it \"should raise an exception if passed a string argument\"\n      it \"should find the cache root\"\n      it \"should create the subdirectory if it does not exist\"\n      it \"should not attempt to create the subdirectory if it already exists\"\n    end\n  end\n\nThe first two examples test to ensure that the object is in a valid state before\nattempting to prepare the cache. The checks are done at the beginning of the method\nand do not have any preconditions, so we can just fill their examples in:\n  describe DataProvider do\n    let(:provider) { create(:data_provider) }\n    let(:userfile) { mock_model(Userfile, :name => \"userfile_double\") }\n\n    describe \"#is_alive?\" do\n      ....\n    end\n    describe \"#cache_prepare\" do\n      it \"should raise an exception if not online\" do\n        provider.online = false\n        expect(lambda{ provider.cache_prepare(userfile) }).to raise_error(CbrainError, \"Error: provider #{provider.name} is offline.\")\n      end\n      it \"should raise an exception if read only\" do\n         provider.read_only = true\n         expect(lambda{provider.cache_prepare(userfile)}).to raise_error(CbrainError, \"Error: provider #{provider.name} is read_only.\")\n      end\n      it \"should ensure that the cache is ready to be modified\"\n      it \"should raise an exception if passed a string argument\"\n      it \"should find the cache root\"\n      it \"should create the subdirectory if it does not exist\"\n      it \"should not attempt to create the subdirectory if it already exists\"\n    end\n  end\n\nThe remainder of the method, however, is more complex. It interacts with other\nmethods in the class, it makes checks on the file system, etc. As before,\nwe will stub out the methods used for these interactions. We could stub the\nmethods separately for each example, but since they all have similar requirements,\nwe can DRY out the stubbing by creating a context block around the remaining methods,\nand using a before(:each) for the stubbing:\n  describe DataProvider do\n    let(:provider) { create(:data_provider) }\n    let(:userfile) { mock_model(Userfile, :name => \"userfile_double\") }\n\n    describe \"#is_alive?\" do\n      ....\n    end\n    describe \"#cache_prepare\" do\n      it \"should raise an exception if not online\" do\n        provider.online = false\n        expect(lambda{ provider.cache_prepare(userfile) }).to raise_error(CbrainError, \"Error: provider #{provider.name} is offline.\")\n      end\n      it \"should raise an exception if read only\" do\n         provider.read_only = true\n         expect(lambda{ provider.cache_prepare(userfile) }).to raise_error(CbrainError, \"Error: provider #{provider.name} is read_only.\")\n      end\n      context \"creating a cache subdirectory\" do\n        before(:each) do\n          allow(SyncStatus).to receive(:ready_to_modify_cache).and_yield\n          allow(DataProvider).to receive(:cache_rootdir).and_return(\"cache\")\n          allow(File).to receive(:directory?).and_return(false)\n          allow(Dir).to receive(:mkdir)\n        end\n        it \"should ensure that the cache is ready to be modified\"\n        it \"should raise an exception if passed a string argument\"\n        it \"should find the cache root\"\n        it \"should create the subdirectory if it does not exist\"\n        it \"should not attempt to create the subdirectory if it already exists\"\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\nNow we can write our examples. For most examples, the approach is simply to customize\nthe stubbing, if necessary, and then use #expect*receive to ensure that critical\nmethods are being called:\n  describe DataProvider do\n    let(:provider) { create(:data_provider) }\n    let(:userfile) { mock_model(Userfile, :name => \"userfile_double\") }\n\n    describe \"#is_alive?\" do\n      ....\n    end\n    describe \"#cache_prepare\" do\n      it \"should raise an exception if not online\" do\n        provider.online = false\n        expect(lambda{ provider.cache_prepare(userfile) }).to raise_error(CbrainError, \"Error: provider #{provider.name} is offline.\")\n      end\n      it \"should raise an exception if read only\" do\n         provider.read_only = true\n         expect(lambda{ provider.cache_prepare(userfile) }).to raise_error(CbrainError, \"Error: provider #{provider.name} is read_only.\")\n      end\n      context \"creating a cache subdirectory\" do\n        before(:each) do\n          allow(SyncStatus).to receive(:ready_to_modify_cache).and_yield\n          allow(DataProvider).to receive(:cache_rootdir).and_return(\"cache\")\n          allow(File).to receive(:directory?).and_return(false)\n          allow(Dir).to receive(:mkdir)\n        end\n        it \"should ensure that the cache is ready to be modified\" do\n          expect(SyncStatus).to receive(:ready_to_modify_cache)\n          expect(provider.cache_prepare(userfile)).to be_truthy\n        end\n        it \"should raise an exception if passed a string argument\" do\n          expect(lambda{ provider.cache_prepare(\"userfile\") }).to raise_error(CbrainError, \"DataProvider internal API change incompatibility (string vs userfile)\")\n        end\n        it \"should create the subdirectory if it does not exist\" do\n          expect(Dir).to receive(:mkdir).at_least(:once)\n          expect(provider.cache_prepare(userfile)).to be_truthy\n        end\n        it \"should not attempt to create the subdirectory if it already exists\" do\n          allow(File).to receive(:directory?).and_return(true)\n          expect(Dir).not_to receive(:mkdir)\n          expect(provider.cache_prepare(userfile)).to be_truthy\n        end\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\nWriting specs to debug code\nIf we find a bug in our code that did not cause an example to fail, this\nindicates to us that our test suite is incomplete. Before debugging the\nactual code, the first step is to write the missing example. Write the example\nso that it fails because of the bug. Then write the code to make the example pass.\nFor example, if we have a simple MyMath class with a method to calculate the square of\na number:\n  class MyMath\n    # Return the square of n.\n    def self.square(n)\n      n * 2\n    end\n  end\n\nClearly, the #square method has a bug. Despite the fact that it would be fairly simple to fix,\nour first step will be to write the failing example:\n  describe MyMath do\n    describe \"#square\" do\n      it \"should return the square of a number\" do\n        MyMath.square(3).to eq(9)\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\nThis test will fail, and now we know that the code is covered (however incompletely).\nSo now we have the coverage on this method so we can modify the method:\n  class MyMath\n    # Return the square of n.\n    def self.square(n)\n      n ** 2\n    end\n  end\n\nAnd now the method will work. Obviously, a proper spec would have more examples,\nbut this should suffice give a general sense of how tests can be maintained and\nupdated while debugging.\nWriting specs for new code (BDD)\nIn order to ensure that the specs are kept up-to-date with respect to the code,\nwe will implement some approaches of behavior driven development (BDD) to our coding\npractices. Essentially, BDD attempts to shift the focus of development to the behavior\nof the code. This is done by first writing specs (in RSpec for us) to define what we\nwant the code to do. The specs should essentially define the API for a piece of code.\nWe are not interested in how code does what it does (i.e. testing the implementation).\nWe just want to make sure that when other code interacts with it, that it behaves\nproperly. At first all the specs will fail (not be satisfied), and then we begin to\nwrite code to satisfy the specs. When we are done, the specs act as regression tests,\nensuring that we do not break old code when writing new code.\nAs an example, we will assume the MyMath class from the previous section has not been\nwritten and we will write it using BDD. One of the tricks to BDD is to make the\nspecs as granular as possible. This involves a certain amount of \"playing dumb\" that\nwill be counter-intuitive, but the end result will be better coverage for our specs.\nSo let's start with a basic case:\n  describe MyMath do\n    describe \"#square\" do\n      it \"should return 0 for 0\" do\n        expect(MyMath.square(0)).to eq(0)\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\nThis will fail because the class has not been written yet, so we will write EXACTLY\nenough code to get it to pass:\n  class MyMath\n    # Return the square of n.\n    def self.square(n)\n      0\n    end\n  end\n\nThis will get the spec to pass. Now we write another example:\n  describe MyMath do\n    describe \"#square\" do\n      it \"should return 0 for 0\" do\n        expect(MyMath.square(0)).to eq(0)\n      end\n      it \"should return 1 for 1\" do\n        expect(MyMath.square(1)).to eq(1)\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\nAnother failure so we add the necessary code:\n class MyMath\n   # Return the square of n.\n   def self.square(n)\n     if n == 0\n       0\n     else\n       1\n     end\n   end\n end\n\nThe spec passes. Now to speed things up, we will add two more examples:\n  describe MyMath do\n    describe \"#square\" do\n      it \"should return 0 for 0\" do\n        expect(MyMath.square(0)).to eq(0)\n      end\n      it \"should return 1 for 1\" do\n        expect(MyMath.square(1)).to eq(1)\n      end\n      it \"should return 4 for 2\" do\n        expect(MyMath.square(2)).to eq(4)\n      end\n      it \"should return 9 for 3\" do\n        expect(MyMath.square(3)).to eq(9)\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\nAt this point we have a bit of coverage, so we can attempt to\nwrite the generalized version of the method.\n  class MyMath\n    # Return the square of n.\n    def self.square(n)\n      n * n\n    end\n  end\n\nAll the tests pass. The take home message from this example is to let the specs\ndictate the writing of the code. This way, we ensure that the coverage of the specs\nis broad and we do not write any code that we do not plan on using.\nNote: Original author of this document is Tarek Sherif.\n\nif ('UA-XXXXXXXXX-X') {\n\t(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){\n\t(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),\n\tm=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)\n\t})(window,document,'script','https://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');\n\n\tga('create', 'UA-XXXXXXXXX-X', 'auto');\n\tga('send', 'pageview');\n}\n\n"},"3-programmer/testing-suite/RSpec-Basics.html":{"url":"3-programmer/testing-suite/RSpec-Basics.html","title":"RSpec Basics","keywords":"","body":"The following is a basic introduction to some of the basic constructs\nin RSpec. This is by no means a complete guide, but should be enough\nto get started writing specs.\nSpecs and examples\nA set of tests for a given aspect of the code (class, module, method) is\nreferred to as a spec and the individual tests are examples. The\nfirst step when writing a spec is to require the spec_helper file, and\nthen create a describe block which defines what we're writing a spec for.\nFor example, to write a spec for the Group model, we would start\nlike this:\n  require 'spec_helper'\n\n  describe Group do\n  end\n\nDescribe blocks can be nested, so the next step would be to add a describe\nblock for each method we wish to test. To keep things simple, we will just\nwrite a spec for the #pretty_category_name method:\n  require 'spec_helper'\n\n  describe Group do\n    describe \"#pretty_category_name\" do\n    end\n  end\n\nNow that things are organized, we can write some examples. To do this\nwe write some it blocks for the different cases we wish to test.\nSince #pretty_category_name only has one line we will write an example describing\nhow it should function:\n  require 'spec_helper'\n\n  describe Group do\n    describe \"#pretty_category_name\" do\n      it \"should convert the suffix 'Group' of a class name to 'Project'\"\n    end\n  end\n\nWhen the method it is called this way, without a block, the example is\nconsidered pending. We can fill it in with some code to test the method.\n  require 'spec_helper'\n\n  describe Group do\n    describe \"#pretty_category_name\" do\n      it \"should convert the suffix 'Group' of a class name to 'Project'\" do\n        group = SystemGroup.create!(:name => \"sys_group\")\n        user  = User.create!(:login => \"login\", \"password\" => \"password\", ...)\n        expect(group.pretty_category_name(user)).to eq(\"System Project\")\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\nThis is not ideal for a few different reasons:\n\nFirst, we are testing a class (SystemGroup) other than the one we are writing the spec for (Group).\nSecond, the messy creation of the objects will become quite cumbersome if they have to\nbe repeated for each example.\nFinally, the simple fact of having to define ALL attributes on a created object (e.g. because of the many validations on User) makes the code messy and draws focus away from what we are supposed be testing.\n\nLet's deal with the issues one at a time. First, we can pull the object creation\nout of the example in two ways. The first is defining instance variables in a\nbefore(:each) block. A before(:each) block is simply some code run before each\nexample in a given describe block, and can be used for set up:\n  describe Group do\n    before(:each) do\n      @group = SystemGroup.create!(:name => \"sys_group\")\n      @user  = User.create!(:login => \"login\", \"password\" => \"password\", ...)\n    end\n\n    describe \"#pretty_category_name\" do\n      it \"should convert the suffix 'Group' of a class name to 'Project'\" do\n        expect(@group.pretty_category_name(@user)).to eq(\"System Project\")\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\nThe other way is to use let statements. While before(:each) blocks can\nbe used to run arbitrary code, let statements are specifically for setting up\nvariables. In general, they are preferable, since they load lazily, i.e.\nthe object isn't instantiated until the variable is used:\n  describe Group do\n    let(:group) { SystemGroup.create!(:name => \"sys_group\") }\n    let(:user)  { User.create!(:login => \"login\", \"password\" => \"password\", ...) }\n\n    describe \"#pretty_category_name\" do\n      it \"should convert the suffix 'Group' of a class name to 'Project'\" do\n        expect(group.pretty_category_name(user)).to eq(\"System Project\")\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\nNote that the @ marker is no longer used. Now to avoid having to clutter our\ncode with the definition of attributes we're not even testing, we can use factories.\nFactories allows us to create and save models with reasonable attributes. To use them, we define them in the file: \"spec/factories/portal_factories.rb\". We can add the factories we need in the following way:\n  #################\n  # User          #\n  #################\n\n  factory :user, class: NormalUser do\n    sequence(:login)      { |n| \"user#{n}\" }\n    sequence(:full_name)  { |n| \"Bob #{n}\" }\n    sequence(:email)      { |n| \"user#{n}@example.com\" }\n    password              \"Password!\"\n    password_confirmation \"Password!\"\n  end\n\n  factory :normal_user, parent: :user, class: NormalUser do\n    sequence(:login)      { |n| \"normal_user_#{n}\" }\n  end\n\n  #################\n  # Group         #\n  #################\n\n  factory :group do\n    sequence(:name) { |n| \"group_#{n}\" }\n  end\n\nAnd then, we can simplify our spec code as follows:\n  describe Group do\n    let(:group) { create(:group) }\n    let(:user)  { create(:user) }\n\n    describe \"#pretty_category_name\" do\n      it \"should convert the suffix 'Group' of a class name to 'Project'\" do\n        expect(group.pretty_category_name(user)).to eq(\"System Project\")\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\nThis creates the instance we need to run the code. Note that factories also have\na build method to instantiate an object without saving it to the database. We\nhave a problem now, however, in that the group is no longer a SystemGroup, and so\nwill not produce the expected string. Furthermore, since the method is not meant to\nbe used with the base Group class, we will get odd results. We could create another\nfactory for a subclass of Group, but that would be overkill. All we need is one method:\nclass. So instead of instantiating a whole new object, we can just stub the class\nmethod.\nStubbing is a testing technique whereby we intercept method calls on an object, either\nto block them or fix their return values. We can do so in the following way to stub the\n#class method:\n  describe Group do\n    let(:group) { create(:group) }\n    let(:user)  { create(:user) }\n\n    describe \"#pretty_category_name\" do\n      it \"should convert the suffix 'Group' of a class name to 'Project'\" do\n        allow(group).to receive(:class).and_return(SystemGroup)\n        expect(group.pretty_category_name(user)).to eq(\"System Project\")\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\nThis idea of overkill is apparent as well in the case of the user object. It seems unnecessary\nto create an entire User object, just to pass it the method, and it is easier to use\na mock object in this case. A mock object is a dummy object that simply takes the place of another object without doing anything. By default, it will not respond to any methods. Methods can be stubbed to add needed functionality. There are three methods we can use to create mock objects (See RSpec::ActiveModel::Mocks):\n\ndouble: create a basic mock object with no methods. A string is given as a first argument,\nthis string is used to make error messages more readable. A hash can be given as second argument\nto conveniently define stubs.\nmock_model: create a mock ActiveRecord object. This mock will have a few basic ActiveRecord\nmethods already stubbed out. Also, an optional argument can be given to define which model is\nbeing mocked (allowing the model to respond to #is_a? and #class).\nstub_model(model): create an instance of the actual ActiveRecord model, but with methods\ninteracting with the db stubbed out.\n\nFor our purposes, we do not need any ActiveRecord functionality, so we can just use the standard\ndouble method.\n  describe Group do\n    let(:group) { create(:group) }\n    let(:user)  { double(\"user\") }\n\n    describe \"#pretty_category_name\" do\n      it \"should convert the suffix 'Group' of a class name to 'Project'\" do\n        allow(group).to receive(:class).and_return(SystemGroup)\n        expect(group.pretty_category_name(user)).to eq(\"System Project\")\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\nBy default, a mock object will only respond to methods that have been stubbed on it. If we\nfind ourselves needing a mock object on which methods will be called, but without really being\nconcerned about their return values, we can create a mock as a null object. A null object\nwill respond to any methods stubbed on it with the return values defined, and will accept\nand ignore any other method calls without raising a MethodMissing exception. To convert\na standard mock into a null object, we simply call the #as_null_object method on it:\n  double(\"user\").as_null_object\n\nFor the current example, however, this is unnecessary.\nMatchers\nOne line that we did not discuss in the previous section was the line that actually\ndefined our expectation:\n  expect(group.pretty_category_name(user)).to eq(\"System Project\")\n\nRSpec has a very rich set of built in matchers to allow us to define our specs.\nOne simple way to produce a matcher is to use RSpec's be_xxx matchers. The xxx part of the\nmethod name should be a predicate method defined on the object being tested.\nFor example:\n  it \"should not consider an empty object valid\" do\n    expect(Group.new).not_to be_valid\n  end\n\nThe be_valid matcher will call the #valid? method on the user object to test\nthe expectation. Another example would be:\n  it \"should start out with no users\" do\n    expect(create(:group).users).to be_empty\n  end\n\nThis calls the #empty? method on the return value from the call to users.\nThere are also matchers for class comparisons. The be_a matcher uses #is_a? to\ncompare classes:\n  it \"should be a Group\" do\n    expect(SystemGroup.new).to be_a(Group)\n  end\n\nThe be_an_instance_of requires that the classes match exactly:\n  it \"should not be an instance of Group\" do\n    expect(SystemGroup.new).not_to be_an_instance_of(Group)\n  end\n\nWe can also define expectations on method calls using the receive method.\nIn the DataProvider class, we expect the #cache_prepare method to check that\nthe cache is ready to be modified before creating directories. This\nexpectation can be written as:\n  it \"should ensure that the cache is ready to be modified\" do\n    expect(SyncStatus).to receive(:ready_to_modify_cache)\n    expect(provider.cache_prepare(userfile)).to be_truthy\n  end\n\nNote that the expectation is defined before the method is actually called.\nAlso, not that a #receive call also effectively stubs out the method.\nThis is by no means an exhaustive list of the types of matchers available in\nRSpec.
